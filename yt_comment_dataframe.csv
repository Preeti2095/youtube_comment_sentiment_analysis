0,2,"I'm not from the US but I sure as hell know not to point a weapon at a cop, It's extremely senseless."
1,3,"We dont need his ""help to understand what we're seeing"", what we need is a full uncut video to judge for ourself what we're seeing."
2,4,There's a time and a place to fight the police.  It's called a court room.
3,5,"I always wonder why CNN never shows the whole CLIP, JUST spiced sections together. Really hard to believe them on what they do show, when they have so much they don't"
4,6,The fact this is what you choose to cover shows your true intentions.
5,7,Show the part where he stole the cops taser and shot him with it
6,8,"Is one thing to get mad for a man getting shot on the back while running away from the cops. 

But it's a whole different situation when you grab a cop's taser and point it at him. I'm at the cop's side on this one."
7,9,‚ÄúTaser is less than lethal.‚Äù                              In Georgia a taser is considered a lethal weapon
8,10,"How can you try fight cops, steal their weapon and be susprised that they shot you lol"
9,11,I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right but resisting arrest is never a good idea
10,12,a knife or gun is considered a deadly weapon and use of force by the police in those situations are legal. A taser is a non-lethal device by law. The act of shooting a fleeing Brooks in the back while he presented no deadly weapons and only a stolen non-lethal device is... illegal
11,13,"You can't be fighting with police, they have the power to enforce the laws."
12,14,"I watched the entire video multiple times and was shocked how professional that the cops were. They bent over backwards being professional to a guy obviously impaired and the number that he blew proved that. In other words, the guy was bombed and then instead of him complying he acted aggressively grabbing the taser gun and now the cops feared if they were hit and down he could have grabbed the gun and killed them."
13,15,"You conveniently left out that in the struggle he also ripped away a taser from one of the officers, and was actively trying to use it."
14,16,"So the suspect is driving while under the influence of more than two times the legal limit, resists arrest, steals and points the officers taser at the him and people think this is okay?"
15,17,You guys need to post whole videos. For clarity I was talking about the rest of the commentators opinion.
16,18,"PRAY for the world right now,it needs it!!!"
17,19,"""APD SHOOTING EXPLAINED
Before reading below, remember that officers are afforded the same constitutional rights as citizens, so whether they‚Äôre charged for political reasons or not, the facts of the case remain the same until their day in court:"
18,20,"Proportionality requires that any measure that interferes with fundamental rights has a legitimate public purpose and is also appropriate, necessary and proportionate in the narrower sense (""appropriate""). A measure that does not meet these requirements is illegal. (german legal principle)"
19,21,Can you imagine if CNN was the only place you were getting news? You'd know absolutely nothing about nothing
20,22,They sure cut that clip off quick!
21,23,"Wow there is a shocking amount of misinformation in this CNN clip. Patting somebody down does not mean they are not armed, which in this case doesn‚Äôt matter anyways because he became armed when he took the officers taser. While the taser is a less lethal weapon (it can kill under some circumstances), it can easily be used to incapacitate that very near officer which will in turn give him access to that officers pistol, pepper spray, whatever else, and even leave opportunity to use that gun and proximity to take that officer as a hostage. If the officer chose to ‚Äúwait and see what happens‚Äù he may very well be in a position where he is potentially shooting his own partner by accident while attempting to stop the aggressor from drawing his partners pistol or from shooting him or or his partner with said pistol, or having to flee because the aggressor now has a gun and a human body shield- leaving his partner to whatever the suspect happens to think is appropriate which in many cases involves physical, psychological, and sometimes sexual trauma all the way to just being brained all over the sidewalk (though female officers are at greater risk for sexual trauma in captivity). The officers were right not to shoot when the suspect was running, not to shoot when he turned around, and to shoot only after the taser was deployed against another officer. This idea that because it was ‚Äújust a taser‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean this was not a very dangerous situation is just incorrect and CNN needs to either stop telling analysts to make their dialogue fit an agenda if that‚Äôs what they are doing or if not then get an analyst that knows what he is talking about because this guy clearly does not see the danger here which is super rookie."
22,24,Yep officers treated him with respect and everything was great right up to well ur under arrest
23,25,"Watched the whole 42 minute long video and the guy definitely was wrong. Cop was wrong for not shooting legs as well because how he was behind the suspect, he could've shot the legs just as easily he did the upper body."
24,26,"the suspect resisted, fought with the cops, supposedly took a taser from one of the cops, tried to escape, then turned around and fired the taser at the cop. This is not a Floyd case. The cop had no choice. It's all clear in the video."
25,27,I would like to see the police camera front of the vehicles.
26,28,Thank you for teaching me what I saw.
27,29,I've been discriminated by cops so many times. Never did I ever think let me run for it or resist arrest ü§î
28,30,He took one of the officers tasers and ran. Just not caught on this clip that they showed.
29,31,"I always ask myself the same question when it comes to police shootings. ""Don't they train to know where to aim?""

There's a massive difference in aiming at someone with a deadly weapon assaulting you and chasing someone. The guy used a taser, the officer probably panicked, it's understandable that maybe he lost composure in that moment. But this is a prime example of a) where police training fails & b) why police shouldn't be armed."
30,32,Where's the fight and the taser being stripped from the cop? Way to go CNN...great coverage.
31,33,"Also way to omit the best angles. I believe some news organization in Atlanta released the full body-cam, and dash cam footage of the incident which shows everything in extreme clarity. They omit the clear footage of the shooting to leave it to your imagination as they tell you how poorly the officers handled the situation."
32,34,"Drunk & passed out in drive thru, sobriety checked (failed), tried to arrest, resisted and fought officers (and won), escaped and fled with officers taser, then shot at officer with said taser, then stopped by police. 
Poor choice led to an even worse outcome."
33,35,"When inequality , discrimination and disparity becomes unpropitious this is the outcome , balancing systemic steps are important before it turns into either a civil conflict or revolution"
34,36,"I remember in Captain Planet, Mati‚Äôs power of heart linked the other planeteers on an empathic and telepathic degree. His teammates understood and linked together to quickly assess problems and then possibly summon Captain Planet. The key to it was Mati‚Äôs own will that anchored and drove the team to their goals. "
35,37,"btw, considering what happened to mr floyd when he had complied every step of the way, it is not unreasonable to think that any black person would be fearful of 'complying' and choose to run rather than be the next victim of 'murder by cop'.  and it still wound up that way..."
36,38,"So here's the information I've gathered from other videos since CNN loves cutting out that good important stuff. 
The officers had a chat with the guy for a good while to which he admitted and the officers also did the breathalyzer test that wasn't shown in this video (because CNN loves to cut out that important content) and he was way over the limit. After learning that he's way over the limit, the officers try to make an arrest but things get antsy and the dude begins to struggle against the cops taking one of the officer's taser and begins to take off, while he takes off, he points the taser and SHOOTS at the cop right behind him, and yes he actually shot the taser, watch this video. "
37,39,"The police in this case was clearly seeking for an excuse to kill this man.  How in the world could we call those individuals law enforcement?

These practices are obviously deathly wrong, and are nothing, but lynching."
38,40,I had a real conversation with some nice white folks I worked with about situations like this. This guy actually told me a big tip. They hardly ever got arrested for drinking and driving because the local cops knew them and their families and would just let them go. Why?
39,41,"It's easy to monday night quarterback the situation after watching the altercation multiple times, in slow mo, from the comfort of your home. Their need to be a link to the nearest police department recruiting office in ever comment section."
40,42,Teach everyone to respect human. To respect life. To live and enjoy life. Stop these kind of behavior.
41,43,"""I'm really concerned that military has been brought in and the National Guard ‚Äî I think that's a really radical step,"" Lia Cheek, 32, told Business Insider. ""Part of me feels like it's turning into a military state.""
""It's a sign of who our president is ‚Äî he likes to control, he likes to bully, and he's using our military and our people and our tax dollars to bully us and control us, and that's not OK,"" she added. ""We need to keep protesting and using our voices."""
42,44,You know it odd but the more this happens the more I start to see and hear people give any excuse to take another persons life.
43,45,"The fact that she said.. ""white officers and a black man"" is the problem"
44,46,"The full video shows an interesting story where 90% of the incident seemed very professional by the police.  BUT I can not see why it had to end in the use of a firearm.   Most people drink and have bad days, but we don't expect to be short for it.  No one should have died here."
45,47,"When you train police officers to be occupation forces, this will lead to the inevitably results."
46,48,May He rest in peace!
47,49,"It sounds like the cops will definitely walk on this one, and I‚Äôm ok with it. Resisting arrest like that is just crazy. I would‚Äôve expected being shot if I were the black guy."
48,50,"Do yourself a solid and go watch the full video on YouTube, before you react to this unfortunate event."
49,51,"If they didnt want to deal with it that day, they could have said, "" call somebody to get you"" a lot of people get junk and fight all the time. They have no judgement. He had no weapon but taser."
50,52,Wow! I didn't know drunk driving got you the death penalty.
51,53,The officer should of taken control of him from the first second. He's walking up and down telling the man to keep looking for his license. It's so frustrating. They're either putting their foot on your neck or they're walking around like you are their best friend. Just do your damn job. That's what the public wants. We want you to follow procedure and then you go home and they either go home or to jail. But at least all concerned still have their life.
52,54,"He fought the cops, grabbed a cops weapon, drew and fired the weapon while running away. This is justified. Make smart choices people. This is real life, not a video game."
53,55,There needs to be a new law that states you can only use your weapon (gun) if you know-see and record them having it and can confirm. Yes the man was dead wrong for running but police are supposed to be trained to take back control of these situations without taking the easy way out and killing someone. That should not even be a resort in this situation.
54,56,Go watch the full video from the wendy's view. He steals a taser and points it back at police. If the taser were to hit an officer then he has access to a deadly weapon or if they missed a small knife he could kill the offices and keep the taser running while he harms the other officer. He could even turn any of the officer's weapons against civilians in their cars.
55,57,This is one of the legit borderline situations that shooting a suspect COULD be justified.
56,58,"I wonder why an employee couldnt have just went out and knocked on his window. Ive worked a Slow drive thru window before and people do doze off!  I just went out and knocked on glass, and that usually solved the problem!. I could see if I knocked and the person was unresponsive,but cleary, this wasnt the case."
57,59,Didnt that guy took the cop taser and shot it at him while running away?
58,60,"For years we've seen ""drunk stops"" aired on cops where the guy runs away and they never shoot him in the back.  So as wrong as Brooks was (and he is very wrong) this never should have got to the level of lethal force."
59,61,"These cops dont know how to detain somone properly. 

We need to train officers proper  CQC and some Jiu-Jitsu just to hold a person down. From there detain the person, place them in the car. "
60,62,"Here‚Äôs how this goes in Australia.
Have you been drinking 
Yes 
Blow in this "
61,63,"The bias is always in the edit. Provide the full footage for the public to decide. This is what transparency, truth and credibility demands."
62,64,"Imminent danger you say, well in the full video when the police officers try to arrest him, the man resisted arrest, fought them off and then one of the cops uses his tazer, which didn't work. At that time he grabs the cop arm and tries to take away the tazer from the police officer, at that point the cops had no choice but to open fire. It's all on the full lenght video, this video makes it seem the cops shot him for no reason."
63,65,Feel bad for the guy ü•∫
64,66,"I have been in a similar situation after an office party. The police drove me home, and that is what should have happened here, or they should have let him call family. Nothing he did was a capital offence. Police üëÆ don‚Äôt get to be judge, jury, AND executioner.ü•µüò¢ü•µüíÄüá∫üá∏"
65,67,I don't even know what to say. If this is standard operating procedure then we definitely need to make major changes asap. My condolences to the family.
66,68,he got what he deserved  !!  the video shows that the police officer was doing his job  !!  thanks for your job well done police officer  !!   GOD BLESS you all out there  !!
67,69,"I‚Äôve seen the whole arrest, 45 mins of it. The police did a great job but the suspect made a mistake grabbing the taser arming himself. It‚Äôs tragic but suspects need to comply. What if he tasered the police, then took the gun."
68,70,"First of all he was o  private property, a drive through if I am not mistaken, which means that the cops have no authority to be there even if he is sleeping, and over the influence of alcohol.
The fact that they shoot him because he did not want to go to jail for a crime that is punished by a ticket, is no reason to shoot him leathaly, they should try and catch him or seize the car, after all he would eventually come back for it."
69,71,Even if you break the rules you still don‚Äôt deserve to die! What‚Äôs so hard about understanding that?? What do we have a justice system for people come on!
70,72,How can someone running away from you pose an imminent threat?
71,73,"So the guy fought the police when they tried to put handcuffs on him after being passed out drunk in a drivethru, got tazed and still ran off. Then the other camera angle from Wendy‚Äôs shows him take something from a cop and point it at them while trying to escape... Seems like a pretty bad guy to me, I‚Äôd expect to be shot if I did the same things he did"
72,74,I just want to watch the whole video without any commetary... I can rule out my own opinion best that way.
73,75,So y'all really going off an edited video?! No one saw what really happened just what they are being told yet some of y'all just running with this story saying he deserves it üôÖüôÖüôÖ.....
74,76,Funny how they cut off 40 minutes of these officers going out of their way to be nice to this guy. It also showed just how drunk this guy was.
75,77,New normal is so much different from what i expected it to be.
76,78,"Had they already got his information? I'm just curious if he had warrants or something or on probation, otherwise.. just take the DUI.. even if it's your second your only looking at a few days in jail,  why risk your life over such a low level charge."
77,79,"So u telling me when a cop uses the taser, it's a deadly weapon.but when it's used against him it's not?"
78,80,"It‚Äôs tragic how this all unfolded. Unfortunately, once the officers suspected a DIU they had to follow the rules. Changing laws for minor crimes like DIU where the car is impounded and the suspect is ticketed and told to report to court instead of being handcuffed and arrested would have avoided this confrontation. "
79,81,"the evidence was there they didnt need to cuff him, so what he runs away, you ve got him later, police need to come to the uk on a bad situation course, he didnt need to die black men are really strong and thats what frightens the cops"
80,82,"Saw the whole clip; this one is marred with speaking over it, making it difficult to get a clear picture.
The cops weren't racist or hostile, they were actually very polite. So was the victim. It's awful because all parties were super chill until the final split second the guy's decision process went south."
81,83,"Georgia law, a taser is considered a firearm and 2 weeks ago a tazer was ruled a deadly weapon when used on a citizen."
82,84,There's a 43 minute unedited version of the police cam that shows 41 minutes of an ordinary decent police officer doing his duty politely and courteously and 2 minutes of a criminal resisting arrest!
83,85,"Regardless of how it's edited, they showed the 2 most crucial pieces of info we need to see: a pat down of the suspect and the shots being fired. Why shoot an unarmed person even if he was running? If I were black, I'd flee too."
84,86,He seems to be standing on one leg just fine.
85,87,"Try showing the whole video, your making it look unjustified and causing more problems 
You never aim a weapon at an officer and expect not to be shot at! It was justified
This guy obviously had something to hide if he had to avoid being arrested for DUI"
86,88,The guy appears to have taken one of the cop's taser(watched another video of this)...I don't get it: why do they need to kill him if he is running? It would be quite enough to shoot to injure i think....
87,89,Show the full video recorded from the cop's cam. Don't trim it which otherwise suggests that cops in this case are to blame.
88,90,This is causing anxiety that it‚Äôs literally making me sick.
89,91,Make  an effort to demonstrate love; it would make your country a better play
90,92,"Imminent threat includes him incapacitating an officer with the tazer and then possibly gaining posession of the service weapon. Split second like that, he had already showed himself to be willing to steal a weapon and use it."
91,93,"It's deadly to have a taser, specially one that does not belong to you."
92,94,Is it possible to take the guns away from police? Or get permission to use deadly force?
93,95,@Charles Ramsey - He could of easily taken the officers gun a along with the taser during the scuffle.. The pat down that happen before becomes irrelevant.
94,96,For some reason. This was a bad timing and i feel bad for the family of the officers who lost their job and probably being life threatened right  this time when all they did was do the calm process and had to defend themselves. Race is not the issue here.
95,97,"Regardless of him running away with the taser, he shouldn't have been shot to death. The police shouldn't be the judge, jury, and executioner over the decision to end an unarmed man's life."
96,98,"They left out the non important part of the suspect taking the tazer from the officer, running away, and then firing the tazer at the officer.  That video was released before this one."
97,99,Almost the same thing happened to me but cop took my keys and told me he would be back in an hour! I went into store had a cup of coffee cop came back asked me if i was alright and gave me my keys. That was 1981. Back in those days it wasnt all about filling town coffers!
98,100,They woke him up told him to pull over to a parking spot and get some sleep but then he passed out again then the cops woke him up again and started questioning him. That was cut from the video.
99,101,The thing I'm looking at is the driving under the influence issue. This car appears to be stopped and parked with him asleep in the driver's seat. Yes I know he's not properly parked but until the officers asked him to move and park in a specific spot can you call it driving under the influence?
100,102,They wouldn't have let me park the car.
101,103,"Something I noticed is that the officers weapons search of Mr.Brooks only involved what seemed like a pat around the waste area and  then ended with the searching of what seems like Mr.Brooks  back pocket. The weapons search didn‚Äôt seem thorough enough to safely conclude that Mr.Brooks did not have any weapons.  A good weapons search would involve searching  from the waste down and or lifting up pant legs and searching the sides of the shoes.  And also searching from the waste up and or lifting up the persons shirt.  And searching all of the pockets as well.  Onto to the actual shooting of Mr.Brooks.  I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs taser was taken in the first scuffle. But assuming it wasn‚Äôt the taser of the officer which shot at Mr.Brooks ,that would mean he would still have the option to use his own taser. But something else to consider is how many shots was the taser capable of firing ? I‚Äôm talking about individual shots capable of being fired from the taser and not repetitive electric shocks sent from the taser to the already shot taser probes. So how many shots was the taser capable of firing,and was the officer aware of how many shots the taser was capable of firing ? If the taser was only capable of firing one shot,then the matter is a little different. Because if the taser was shot and missed the target ,and the officer still had his taser with him then he could have fired his own taser instead. Something else to consider is were the dangling taser probes still something to be deeply concerned about ? An other thing to consider is that given what seems like not a good enough weapons pat down,the officer could have still have had doubts with regards to whether or not Mr.Brooks had any weapons on him or not. Which would be a another reason for him to have to shoot Mr.Brooks. That little bit of doubt in the weapons search can make for lack of confidence/stability with regards to the officers handling of the whole matter.  A thorough weapons search helps rule out certain matters. It helps in moving forward with more confidence during the investigation. It can help in doing what‚Äôs best for the officer and the person being investigated. "
102,104,"There may have been some confusion as to what weapon he grabbed from the other officer.
Did he just grab the taser, or did he also get a gun? Rayshard brought this on himself."
103,105,"The black men need to learn an old song "" I fought the law and the law won""   if black men are supposedly so terrified of cops why they fighting and resisting. Duh  they were very polite and even asked if he needed an ambulance they didn't know if maybe he was sick but then he goes berserk and becomes a threat"
104,106,Smh.  Why did he resist!? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Clearly this could have been prevented
105,107,"Show the video where you see the suspect stopped fleeing, turned back and pointed the stollen Tazer at the officers and then was shot. Your partial and therefore misleading footage will have people make biased conclusions."
106,108,I am seeing 3 things here. 1 police competence 2. Police incompetence 3. A felon who makes a bad decision to run. The cops checked that he didn‚Äôt have a weapon. How did he think he was gonna get away with not being arrested and then try and run and leave behind his car. He is gone now but demonstrates that each party must take some responsibility!
107,109,"The suspect was willing to do anything. He did fight 2 cops, stole a taser (weapon) from them and pointed it against them. You can not risk that he tasers you and get your gun. The shots were 100 percent legal. The mayor of the city should retire for falling into the 2 cops back so fast."
108,110,Holy shit! What a tragedy!
109,111,"I live in the UK and can‚Äôt understand why the police were called, I‚Äôm absolutely sure that staff here  would have tapped on the window and asked‚Äù Sir you want to order‚Äù and if he didn‚Äôt wake it wouldn‚Äôt be the police  they‚Äôd call it would be an ambulance."
110,112,We got to do better we got to think before we act
111,113,"The cops got emotional and shot him bc, basically, a drunk man over powered them and about got away. At first I was like he drew a weapon but then it was revealed it was a taser from the officer. So, they knew he did not have a weapon and had taken their taser. They have his car w/ the plates. It‚Äôs not like he was going to get away or was about to hurt someone. He was running away. Just like a home invasion, if you shoot at a robber, in the back, as they were running away, you‚Äôd be in trouble b/c you were not in imminent danger. Having an assailant‚Äôs back to you suggest they are trying to get away from you, not trying to harm you. A cop knows how far a taser can shoot, if he feared getting tased, he could have fallen back and it would not even reach. The guy fell a sleep at a drive thru, he will pass out again. There was no immediate danger to the police or the public. They could have canvased the area and prob found him passed out somewhere again or got his address from the plates and find him in his home passed out. They shot him bc they got emotional about getting punched in the face and having their weapon taken from them. Their egos got hurt and there‚Äôs nothing more dangerous than a cop with a bruised ego."
112,114,"I saw an individual resisting arrest then after that its anybody's guess. The individual might have been reaching for an officer's gun/taser during the scuffle. The point is he broke the law, it could have been all avoided if he just complied, and not resisted."
113,115,"It's the law that the police cannot shoot a person fleeing unless it's an immediate defense of life or serious bodily injury. 

The man's car was already parked, he was drunk and they had his ID. You're telling me they couldn't chase him? The cop fucked up and people in the comments are bitching about the video being edited as if it justifies the killing."
114,116,"So, a drunk gets into a fight with 2 officers, slaming one to the ground steals a weapon and turns to fire it back at cops as he runs away and nobody can inderstand why he got shot??"
115,117,Imagine if the cop just said we will have to give you a ride home you can‚Äôt operate your vehicle for the night. But not in this day and age where all of this at the end was about money not justice but money. America is not a country it‚Äôs a business.
116,118,Be a man before you become a police
117,119,"Yes, just carefully leave out the part where he took the taser from the police"
118,120,"yeah, I am having a hard time with this one being a justified shooting...Yes, he did turn the taser at an officer and shot it...all officers are shot with the taser in the academy so they can experience it first hand but I think that is only so they are careful with voltages etc...did it warrant  lethal force...I'm not sure because we didn't have tasers when I went through my training...Lethal force is only used when you feel your life or another life is in immediate danger...Tasers only have two cartridges but in the hands of an untrained individual does it constitute as a deadly weapon...maybe"
119,121,He had it coming.
120,122,"He could have just gotten away with a night in jail and maybe losing his driver's license, but he just had to resist arrest and run away with a taser (and then shoot it at the police ?? Huh ? ) , ok, that was stupid dude ! Guy nust have been really drunk or really high on drugs...."
121,123,"Over and over and over, I am reading these comments and again they are missing the MASSIVE point: the police CANNOT discharge their weapon unless they are in Danger. Not if the suspect is resisting, not if he runs away, not even if he grabs a taser, it has to do with the Officer being in Danger. None of those were in play as the suspect was fleeing and the Officer choose to discharge his weapon."
122,124,its amazing how (some) people think they have the right to decide if someone deserves to die...(some) people see this video and say he deserved to die...but in reality it shows how sick and adjusted (some) people have become. they could have let him go...he wasnt doing anything....and(some) people will never understand our perspective of injustice...what do u see when u watch this video? the officer even asked himself if  he wanted to deal with this dude right now? which means he had a choice to escalate or not..  and this did not need to be escalated..
123,125,"He might of been drunk and when they were gonna cuff him he drunkenly thought ""heres my chance to dip"", as any self respecting drunk person would at least think of."
124,126,"The complete primitive American way of law enforcement! In Germany the guy has to step out and is asked to do do immediately an alcohol test by breathing in that test thing. If he is clear he can go. If not he has to hand over the car keys. A cop is parking the car at the side and secures it. Later the man gets a ticket, maybe a day in court for being drunk and driving. That's it. There is no reason ever that a gun must be pulled in this case! And the guy has never a reason to feel threatened! Learn a thing or two from other civilized countries, people!"
125,127,Doesn't justify the shooting at all.  But it was informative and I appreciate the transparency.
126,128,Police did a good job here
127,129,"Don't watch CNN, watch the entire footage, approx. 41 mins long, and go figure it out yourself. The police did nothing wrong in this case."
128,130,"I'm starting to think cops uniform need more flexibility...they look  stiff in the time of action, or could it be they are not in shape ? Law enforcement needs to go under state of emergency themselves so they can regroup, find new approaches and develop new training skills. Another example of the ego being high jacked by fear!"
129,131,I was pinched for DWI over 30 years ago by 2 white cops. I was polite and listened to their commands. I ran a red light and was pulled over. They were justified in pulling me over. Went to the station and met the lieutenant. A gentleman who treated me with respect. He was doing his job. Did I curse him or threaten him or his officers? No. They noted this to the judge. I still had to pay a price. Yet I am alive today to speak about it.
130,132,WHY DID CNN EDIT THE VIDEO TAKE OUT THE PART WHERE HE TOOK THE TASER GUN?
131,133,The Taser didn't stop em . So let's shoot em KNOWING he doesn't have a weapon because they patted him down BEFORE Gunning him down üòî smh
132,134,1:25 That one guy that recorded the fight.
133,135,"The police need tactics like choke holds to subdue a suspect that is fighting with police , the only thing is when you have the suspect under control it‚Äôs time to release choke hold and put suspect in car which they did not do in Floyd case. It wasn‚Äôt the knee on the neck, it was the timing once he had Floyd restrained he should have put him in the car  and that‚Äôs why they are charged with murder because all three cops had their knees on him"
134,136,"How about another joke? 
What do you get when you take a cops weapon away and try to shoot him with it?"
135,137,And just like the cops we're going to investigate ourselves and find ourselves not guilty.
136,138,"""The Officer Tatum"" YouTube channel has the angle they're not showing you!  And, he even explains why deadly force was justified!

Highly recommend his channel. I love his videos, at least most of them. Even if you are a Leftist, it'll provide a distinctive view of officers."
137,139,"They armchair quarterback is forgetting one thing and this video is short. They asked if he had any weapons and he got a quick pat, they never got a chance to do a search incident to arrest because you don't do that until a suspect is in cuffs. What they and everyone knows is he was compliant and officers respectful until he initiated non-compliance and resisted arrest fir a violation, he then assaulted 2 officers, he then took a taser which became a weapon of opportunity fled and used it shooting at police as he fled. So a violent aggressor, who just assalted police with a weapon of opportunity and no problem using it against police gets shot? That is what is happens when you make decisions like this. Had he ran, no weapon and the shot him i would be grilling the police. Had the police acted in any way other than a professional manner or treated him with less respect due any person of any race, i would be again grilling their asses. What i am not going to do is give Mr. Brooks a pass on decisions he made leading up to his arrest, you do something, even something stupid, own that shit like a man. I damn sure am not gonna give him a pass on the resisting arrest, assault, commandeering a police, use of a police weapon at police. And i am definitely not going to give him a pass just because he is black and the cops are white."
138,140,Real reforms needed now.  Every police officer should re-apply for their job with higher standards required.
139,141,"Yes, so if you were that cop, you're telling me you wouldve just Stood there and Taken the taser to the face or wherever it would've landed?? You'd Seriously just Take that Tase? I don't know about that. I'm gonna be honest. Plus it looks like he Fired it and Then the cop was in the middle of pulling it out. Every Human being is Different...having Different reactions, lives, and thoughts. Yes it wouldve been Good for All to be alive, and if the cops had beaten him up and Then tried to handcuff him, Yes I wouldve understood his reaction. But let me say this, the TAPE says it all. The George Floyd cop...yeah THAT Was Flat out Wrong and Unnecessary. They were In Control of George already. These cops though...different story. Nonetheless the tape is there. I mean when the cop was gonna tase him on the ground after resisting...I'd understand Why he reached for it. Who wants to be tased that Close."
140,142,Yeah that definitely didn't need to happen. If there's one thing I'm learning it's that calling the cops definitely escalate the situation.
141,143,"You know that meme: Ah shit, here we go again."
142,144,"I mean I see a lot of these videos, the man shouldn‚Äôt have been killed or shot for that matter. But people have to see this subjectively, a lot of these videos people are resisting arrest. The videos also show not a lot of compliance."
143,145,They edited out alot of footage..the police were not mean to him he chose to resist arrest after approximately 40 mins of talking calmly to him
144,146,"Me just wonder: If US police officers are now forbidden to take life-threatening strangleholds or similar measures during arrests, will that not lead them to resort to firearms? Means: there will be more deaths from firearm use."
145,147,"I‚Äôm not watching the news anymore. I‚Äôve been so focused on watching every news network at night time that I even go to bed way past 9pm and this is not ok. 
I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôll come back whenever we have positive news I‚Äôm over it now. I‚Äôm over it. "
146,148,"Some people are sick in the head. Dui, resisting arrest and assault on a police officer are all crimes and he should have received 2 to 8 years in prison depending on the judge. Not a death sentence on the spot. No man should be judge jury and executioner as that cop chose to be."
147,149,"This is all his fault, and hell I'm black as they come, bruh it's up to you to still use better judgement than that. First of all you could have killed people yourself driving drunk"
148,150,"WATCH THE FULL CLIP for yourselves. What strikes me about ALL these circumstances is each ""victim"" was breaking the law in some way or another (hence why the police were there in the first place). So... whatever happened after that especially in this case,; the ""victim"" brought upon himself. When honest decent people are randomly picked up and shot by police... that will be a discussion worth having. But in these cases... ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? The Devil is a LIE!"
149,151,"They should have let him run, they have his car."
150,152,I'm exhausted...
151,153,"I hear blame on the police side, but I never heard any single suggestion from these leaders telling people NOT to resist arrests.  And obviously, don't run away, don't take tasers from police.  How do we know that he (intoxicated) didn't even think that was a gun?  That kind of action is criminal."
152,154,"I don't care how you ""try"" to justify what happened here it wasn't worth him losing his life. When did shoot to kill become the protocol for a suspect fleeing after resisting!?!?!?!?!?"
153,155,I'm sorry for what happen but that's way different from what happen to George Floyd. That guy shouldn't have done that
154,156,"Lesson here is don't resist the Police, and don't fire a taser gun at them!"
155,157,Don't start a fight with the police.
156,158,"Cop had his car, why shoot him. He was running away so the cop didnt fear for his life and he was patted down so they know he is unarmed. All they had to do if they couldn't catch him was run the plates and investigate. He could arrested with more cops at his home with a warrant"
157,159,"In May when the cops used a taser on the college kids, nobody had a problem when the cops were charge with aggravated assault. The taser was considered a weapon that can cause severe bodily harm and possibly lethal. 
In this case the guy shot twice at cops and they are trying to say they shouldn‚Äôt have shot him because it wasn‚Äôt lethal."
158,160,"OMG, dont make one that withstand  good police a hero AGAIN, that just insane. Dont make the police loss their dignity. We need them to make our the community save. What is happening in police depart. they are so week now, cannot protect their own man. why every time some one mush up all of the sudden the police get punish, so stupid."
159,161,"That one leg stand was a good performance he wasn't bobbing and weaving he passed on that for the time I saw it ,"
160,162,smh this could spark the protest even more
161,163,"Hmmm.... could an officer be disabled with a taser? Could an officer have bodily harm done to him in that state or have his weapon taken?
Has the use of a weapon been demonstrated?
Could a member of public be harmed?"
162,164,If he had cooperated he would still be alive. They were treating him with respect until he tried to run and then shot at them with the tazer. He shouldn't have been shot but honestly that's what they're trained to do so it's not their fault. Its the laws and training in that area. Why did he run??
163,165,"Although the cops assumed that the driver was drunk, they told him to move the car and then charged him for drinking and driving?

One should definitely not fire a taser towards a cop."
164,166,"He was armed after he took the cops tazer..... And then he fired the tazer at police, you know a tazer is used to incapacitate right? How do you know he didnt think he had the cops gun? In the heat of the moment you arent examining the weapon you just took.  why did this guy fight so hard? I can't see it being for dui alone."
165,167,Japan: I'll just use a train and come and get the car tomorrow.
166,168,guy had some drinks and probably smoked some weed having a good night he had a good 30-40 years of life left but he decided to resist arrest.  smart move.  he probably had some priors/warrants or something.  i committed a crime once and the cops pulled up behind me and I just unbuckled my seat belt but didn't get out because I didn't want to get shot and waited for them.  they opened the door and got me lol i didn't resist!
167,169,"""we are social justice warriors! We want a positive change! We are here to help bring that change!...now let's burn the Wendy's down!!!"""
168,170,"I don't know if anyone is catching it but the cop who was chasing him had already stuck his taser cables into Brooks. It looked like he was running with those attached and at some point he pointed the taser that he grabbed as a way to ward off by maybe trying to distract the cop so he could put distance between them. I also am wondering from some of the other footage, it looks like the cop pulled out his taser and hit him with it and Brooks grabbed it to keep it from being used against him. Then decided that it might be best to take it with him as he ran away so that it couldn't be used to electrocute him as he fled."
169,171,Careful what you watch....we‚Äôre all being ‚Äútriggered ‚Äú....show the whole video....or interview the people in the drive thru line...very difficult to get an unbiased view of anything in this country..
170,172,There is something really wrong with the police in the States. Things like this are happening once in a decade here in Europe.
171,173,"Hi there, I‚Äôm Rashard Brooks. I was sentenced to 7 years in prison for beating my KIDS. I was paroled due to the covid-19.
I drove drunk to Wendy‚Äôs and passed out in the drive through line, when a cop tried to arrest me for my 2nd dui I stole his taser and fired it at him because I knew I would be sent back to prison...I‚Äôm a martyr now..."
172,174,Oh my God üòîüòû ain't kill cuz I got booze ‚úäüèΩ
173,175,"The odds of bad stuff happening to you, increase when you resist arrest."
174,176,"Well atleast the guy in this case had actually committed a crime and had resisted arrest, so it's a step up from simply being murdered outright as so often appears to be the case."
175,177,The punishment for assaulting an officer isn‚Äôt death. He was running away when they shot him. He was not a threat to the officers‚Äô health at that point!
176,178,"the POLICE would have finished arresting him and trying to put handcuffs on him, this man would have been alive. Instead this GIY started fighting POLICE and pulled the taser from cop. Started running and turned around and firedtazer toward cops. Then 1police officer shot him and then they did CPR  on him.  Sorry this guys life ended but, if he didn't do what he did, he would still be alive."
177,179,"Well, they knew who he was, had his car and they could have just gone to his home and arrested him.
I never understand why they shoot people who run. Maybe they need some better fitness training if they can't run down a chubby man."
178,180,Y‚Äôall edited that video and took out the part the guy stole the cops taser...
179,181,"The more scums we get ride off, the safer our streets will be for the sake of every communities"
180,182,I wish they would do a story on what happened to Breonna Taylor.  She was an EMT shot in her own home by police during a no-knock raid.
181,183,People haven't learned yet. Don't fight the police. You will never win!
182,184,"Died over a DUI?? ü§£üòÇ
It's a night in jail and a court date, bruh."
183,185,"This video is edited with intent, in other news clips that show the suspect taxers the officer. I used to watch cnn all the time, but increasingly saw them minipulaiting the story. This is one example."
184,186,He was running for his life
185,187,saying you have no weapon really doesn't mean anything anymore..
186,188,"I was totally wrapped up into the George Floyd incident and what happened to that poor man, but it got to be too much. I watch the big 3 on CNN just about every night, but lately I can't watch them because of have one-sided they are. Don Lemon is through the roof with it. As I said I haven't been watching the news, but I just watched the full video of this. WTF?? This cop did everything by the book and was completely tolerant, too tolerant, of this man and his actions. Again, we go back to another guy resisting, but he took it to another level and grabbed a weapon from the cop. WTF? I can't even finish this I'm so disgusted."
187,189,Good luck U.S. & A.
188,190,"The bodycam from police tells everything.  

(1)   Was Rayshard Brooks caught in red hand doing something criminal?"
189,191,"They don't want to accountable what they've done. They just want justice how they've treated of result of their behavior and I'm not talking about cop.

But I agree that cop could've used fire weapon more different way to minimize casualty but what if he tased cop and took his gun? they don't understand how dangerous it was."
190,192,"Resisting arrest is never good, neither is pointing and firing an object at night at an officer. Sorry for his death, but a little wise decision making goes a long way. People need to learn you resist in court not in the street in the middle of the night."
191,193,"How difficult is it to know that ""YOU DON'T RESIST ARREST."""
192,194,Exactly ! !
193,195,Yeah That's insane...CNN just having shown what they've shown on this clip.
194,196,In this day and age it is NOT beneficial to your health to run from the cops AND fire a taser at them. ü§¶üèæü§∑üèæ The cops should've just caught up with him later on when he came home to make the arrest. His life saved and money in their pockets. ü§∑üèæ
195,197,"When someone fires a taser that you  yourself was prepared to use on him, that doesnt warrant a lethal force in return. The decision to use a gun was disproportionate to the threat of a taser"
196,198,"So sad, really wish he didn't shoot the taser, seemed like a chill guy. Looks like suicide by cop"
197,199,"If you watch the full video from the Wendy‚Äôs camera, the officers chased him down on foot and only shot at him after Brooks discharged the taser at them and headed for a car in the drive through."
198,200,"He blew a 1.08. Not a .108
That's a big difference. Have some integrity jeez."
199,201,He got what he got CNN watch the whole dam video he was wrong cops did the right thing
200,202,"Yes edit out the parts for the he punched the cops in the face, if he would have complied you would be alive"
201,203,"Technically - as he was fleeing he was no longer unarmed as, in the struggle he had grabbed and then used the officer's taser.
Two questions don't seem to have been asked - 
Why was he being put into cuffs for DUI? "
202,204,"I think the police were in the right in this situation. Once he stole and ran away with their taser, it was justified for the police to use their guns."
203,205,"You do not have to do the field sobriety test,as you can fail it for normal reasons,they can not make you do it"
204,206,"Yes he made a mistake, but there was no reason for the police to shoot him. You could always catch him another day and give him the additional charge of having resisted arrest. In the military I was taught that a firearm during peacetime is meant for protection, and only discharged when there is an imminent threat towards you or the people you are protecting. You are supposed to meet the escalation level, attempt to de-escalate, and never to escalate further. A taser may have been a threat (as seen in the extended version of this video), but not one that requires an immediate use of a firearm. Furthermore, shots should be made to disarm, and not to kill. Shooting and killing this fleeing criminal made the police the judge and the jury on that man‚Äôs life. If they had let him go then, the law would still have caught up with him eventually. Not all criminals deserve the death penalty."
205,207,"I'm for BLM and against police brutality. I saw the whole video. The police did nothing wrong from start to finish. They did the right thing to protect themselves. But seriously, 2 cops couldn't hold the man down and the man took the police tazer.."
206,208,"Europe: 'You'll have to pay a fine and call someone to pick you up, walk home or use public transportation """
207,209,"somehow only half the people can read, It says bodycam video shows moments leading up to fatal shooting, and with her saying that its new video its meant to add to the video that was already seen which included the taking of the empty taser and him fleeing, we already have seen that footage there's no editing out anything its just an additional input into the case."
208,210,"Brooks made a plethora of bad choices the night he was killed, including, fighting with the police, resisting arrest, firing a taser at the police, and having the munchies and falling asleep at the Wendy's drive-thru."
209,211,"a few weeks ago the judge who convicted the cop who shot rayshad and the other cop, charged 2 cops for aggravated assault on college students with a taser. aggravated assault suggests that the weapon they were using was in fact a deadly weapon. If he thinks a taser is a deadly weapon in that situation then why isnt it a deadly weapon in this situation? BECAUSE OF DOUBLE STANDARDS."
210,212,"When i was in high school, they taught us how to behave if we ever got pulled over by an officer. My school had all races, including whites. Is that still not taught in schools? If not, then that should be something BLM should be asking for when requesting policy changes."
211,213,I‚Äôm wondering if he had a little something on him that he shouldn‚Äôt have. A DUI isn‚Äôt a huge offense - especially when you‚Äôre just sitting passed out in a drive through
212,214,It‚Äôs the same story just a different name- the hate you give (2018)
213,215,He left out a big part of the use of deadly force. ‚ÄúIf your life or another is in imminent danger or threat of serious bodily injury‚Äù an officer getting tased and  eating cement is very very bad for the üß†. Use of deadly force was authorized . Tasers are LESS lethal and not NON Lethal devices.
214,216,"Usually when one is drunk, they don't make good decisions. Perfect example.
Tons of footage, failed sobriety test, and attacking an officer. 
Cant fix stupid."
215,217,Officers (Police) lives were NEVER in danger. Officer took that man life because his feelings were hurt. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Grow a pair and do your job or find a new one... oh that's right you were fired. #ThatManLifeMattered
216,218,"Proper Police Reform... 
Double their numbers. Double their salaries. 
Give them leaders that they can trust. ~{¬∞¬°¬∞}~"
217,219,"Well he summed that up, none of those officers lives were threatened with lethal force, so that man should not dead. Here we go again"
218,220,"It seems to me that the shooting was uncalled for...if the officer was alone and was going to be tased while chasing him...a different story...but if the one cop of the two that shot him felt like someone's life was in danger from a taser...says all cops endanger lives every day using tasers...you can't outrun a radio, and they had his car..."
219,221,The man was armed and dangerous the second he got into a 2 tone moving vehicle and drove it around and did not care. I have lost a good neighbor who left behind two kids cause he was waiting at a traffic light waiting to turn green when a drunk truck driver wiped him out. Stop pretending this was an innocent man who was shot for no reason. Go see the other footage.
220,222,"I'll be honest at 1st (before watching the video) I thought the cops were justified, but knowing that they patted him down and he was found to have no weapons on him, that was excessive force. "
221,223,"To be safe and cooperatif with the police, Just don't resist and fight. Do what's officer asked."
222,224,‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know if he was drinking at this point‚Äù. He fell asleep twice in the drive through with his car on. Luckily he didn‚Äôt run anyone over.
223,225,"IF HE IS RUNNING AWAY, YOU LET HIM RUN AND LEAVE!! YOU  GOT HIS CAR THERE, RUN HIS LISCENSE ETC. CATCH UP WITH HIM LATER.  If he wants his car tell him come down to the station and get it.  No sense killing a man."
224,226,Shortened and edited: that is your first clue how this is going to be biased when the commentator says that
225,227,0:04 do you really have to put race into everything?
226,228,"The commentator is correct about the  use of  deadly force, irregardless of what transpired before.  While the officers had at their disposal the use of overwhelming force, the suspect did not. A taser doesn't qualify.  However, with that being said, once an officer is incapacitated with a taser then, access to his firearm is possible."
227,229,why did he run from the police ?
228,230,You missed the part where the dude pointed the cops‚Äô taser at the policeman...
229,231,"No body is above the laws, he should obey the officers investigation terms politely and good manners.
Police officers are doing their job!!"
230,232,He was asking for it taking that taser and using it against the police. That should be classified as suicide by cops.
231,233,Plane and simple he was asking to get shot epically after seeing so many other brothers get shot for lesser reasons he grabbed the taser and shot it at him why was he fired and why all the talk about it the cops where doing their jobs right i think he could have shot him in the leg but nevertheless they where polite & did their jobs right
232,234,Premeditated murder because that cop had murder on his mind!
233,235,Uhmmm show the dash cam video of the  car where it shows the entire thing .... way to show a body cam perspective that fell off
234,236,Show the other videos which shows the suspect stole and fired the taser at the officer. Stop playing hide the ball CNN.
235,237,"I like drinking... but I don‚Äôt get behind the wheel when I do it.  Dude was so drunk he fell asleep with the car running.  At that point the police have to do something, and you have to admit there‚Äôs a problem."
236,238,So a baseball bat is considered less than lethal but when you swing it a few times it can become lethal. A taser can be lethal if the person getting hit falls to the ground and hit their head on the ground and dies. He didn't want to go to jail that night for owi so he paid with his life.
237,239,2 ppl died in police custody in my city today
238,240,"1:46 - 1:46 somebody held the body cam. After that the body cam is on the ground. 

Also since we cannot see if the guy is not armed or not, there is a benefit of the doubt that there could be a hidden weapon that was not frisked"
239,241,Wow they are distracting us with police work. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
240,242,"To those curious, in the full video Rayshard takes the cop's stun gun and tries to shoot the cop with it. With everything in mind, I still don't think that warrant's shooting him in the back with a real gun."
241,243,"""People are awesome?""...try people are stupid...look at some of the comments in this comment section."
242,244,"He couldn‚Äôt have been that drunk if he was asleep at the drive through of Wendy‚Äôs. Now if you found someone in the drive through Taco Bell asleep after ordering a Crunchwrap,that person is beyond drunk falling asleep after having placed such a dank order."
243,245,I saw a guy point a weapon at a cop.  What do you think will happen?
244,246,So they weren't strong enough or fast enough to catch him and just shot him smh
245,247,"The officer knows there‚Äôs only one round in the taser which he used so the cop should of known he was no longer a threat , he should have just gave him one warning shot that‚Äôs it not kill him"
246,248,Oh wow.... no more explanation. Video starts & stops at the perfect timeü§î
247,249,This man broke several laws during this incident . He threatened an officer with a weapon. He had a long criminal rap sheet. The cops did NOTHING wrong.
248,250,"How can you VERY violently attack two police officers, grab a Tazer off them, and not expect to be shot?"
249,251,"He knew if he got cuffed and put on the ground the officer would prob ""take the knee"". Shoot first ask questions later seems to be the merica way."
250,252,ANOTHER EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW DRUG'S AND ALCOHOL ARE ALWAYS THE COMMON DENOMINATOR BEHIND EACH AND EVERYONE OF THESE INCIDENTS!
251,253,"In the original video, BEFORE THIS WAS RELEASED. You can clearly see that he took possession of the polices weapon and aimed back at them."
252,254,He took the taser and pointed at the police officer! Then he tried to run off. That is a threat and in my opinion could cause harm to public and the police. It was justified. The news need to show the whole story. I'm done.
253,255,"amazing how so many ppl claiming ""its just a taser"" that he stole dont seem to know what happens to a person that gets tased.

he aimed it back at the cops while running away which is shown on the wendys security camera footage."
254,256,The policeman has to listen  and after  see what type the help the. person need. Special  with if don't have  drugs  or guns. When you shut  somebody if your life in danger's. But don't  do for killing.
255,257,"He fought with officers and tried to steal their taser then ran off?
They've burned that branch of Wendy's down?
Uh."
256,258,"This is far different issue with George Floyd and the rest. first of all, you are resisting arrest, second your taking a taser and using it against a law enforcement officer, pretty dumb move I would say. Your sleeping at the wheel at a Wendy‚Äôs drive thru dumb from the beginning. Officers were doing there job. Stop making all cops look bad, there are good ones out there just doing there job feeding there families."
257,259,Obey the law and you are home right now...Why resist-point a gun and run??? He struck out 3 times. Some officers are a...holes but a little respect goes a long way!!!
258,260,Here we go again! Keep on fanning the flames CNN.
259,261,"What happen to shooting in the legs? For christ sake... life is precious... that man has a mom/dad and other people thats gonna suffer.

You had a back up cop with u... shoot the legs why killed him over a taser?"
260,262,"If he's running away, did he get shot in the back?"
261,263,I wonder which one of their news anchors will cry today.üòÇ
262,264,"What was the crime? Did it require deadly force, I know it didn‚Äôt, why are the police not taught this. This is murder clearly. These aggressive police tactics need to be removed from policing. God bless the victims."
263,265,The whole point here is STOP RESISTING ARREST!!!
264,266,"SAD, but very simple... 
HE DID NOT HAVE A GUN!!!
NO TREAD TO POLICE!!!
NO REASON TO FIRE!!!"
265,267,We must always look within ourselves frist. And make the changes. Starting to show love between ourselves. Then we'll see the real changes
266,268,If so many cops fear for their lives they should just quit. You got to be Insane to fear for your life and go to work. That whole fear for their life is complete bullshit in most situations
267,269,My dad taught me not to fight cops or shoot them with a weapon.thay will kill me I am 68
268,270,Cops gonna get off like they always do.
269,271,"If he had not resisted arrest, he would still have his life...He went for the taser, which can incapacitate the officer and go for the police officers' firearm instead."
270,272,"Just saw what I thought was a flashlight was a taser that has a light beam on it.
But why shoot him for a taser??"
271,273,"They shot him because they ""lost"" when he started to run away."
272,274,Good evidence
273,275,Wathing murder cases daily becoming new life style
274,276,"Blocking the path, DUI, resisting arrest and (not on this video) assaulting and officer with a taser while trying to scape. What can we expect from this?"
275,277,seems like if he was a potential threat they wouldn't have given him the opportunity to drive his car to the side from the beginning smh
276,278,Everybody talking about calling an uber. Dude should have called one before he left the house. How about that?
277,279,"This video is sickening. Screen moved around so much, it gave me nausea."
278,280,Common sense is not that common anymore :(
279,281,"Although he did not need to be killed, I will always wonder why he ran."
280,282,The cops picked up their brass before attending to him. His life could've possibly been saved.
281,283,Well they tried tazing him like 5 times ü§î so I'd say it's legit
282,284,He shot at the cop with the taser
283,285,"Here‚Äôs a crazy thought when the cops are cuffing you don‚Äôt resist and grab their taser...that said running away back turned no need to shoot at that point...but you‚Äôre asking cops to react like a robot, not going to happen emotions high they were just attacked (resisting arrest and taking the cops taser and shooting it at them is an attack).  My god I would never want to be a cop...it was hard before but now it‚Äôs plain ridiculous"
284,286,So sad
285,287,Lotta missing footage CNN
286,288,It‚Äôs on 11Alive check it out full uncut footage
287,289,"The guy was operating a vehicle intoxicated(which could result in multiple fatalities) he failed a sobriety test, tried to fight the cops after they were nothing but patient, then stole their taser and ran. Instead of pulling out his gun immediately they actually TASEd him first! HE continues to flee (with a stolen police weapon (lethal or non) and expects them to let him run into the night or into some poor unsuspecting citizen near by. This cop should sue for being wrongfully fired."
288,290,What the hell?! Everything seemed by the book and calm until the cuffing. What spooked him?
289,291,"No, CNN didn‚Äôt show the whole video but that is beside the point. The argument is about the use of lethal force. 

I don‚Äôt know the whole story and can only rely on video and personal testimonies, however from my educated perspective, I believe there were other options besides the use of lethal force. The man resisted arrest, ran away with the cop‚Äôs taser, proceeded to shoot taser at the cop while running away only to get fatally shot. "
290,292,"He was drunk and acted irrationally when panicked but he still didn‚Äôt deserve to die, so many people have done worse and are still alive"
291,293,"Don't forget folks while your feeling sorry for him. Had he gotten away, Atlanta Fugitive Squad would have been looking for him this week. He was going to prison for his actions after the attempted handcuffing. This man did everything wrong one could do from that point forward. He wasn't killed a Racist cop looking for blood, he got himself killed by being stupid AF and it's evident to any sane person. Once you get to fighting with the cops all bets are off and anything can happen, regardless of race, sex, or state of mind.  For those that say they could've let him walk home. Had he come back and got that car a hour later, the Atlanta police department would've been held accountable had he hit and killed someone. Remember folks he was so drunk he passed out behind the wheel. This wasn't a man that had a few beers and got caught. He had enough to pass out. Either he can't handle his alcohol, or he over indulged and put others at risk driving.  I've seen people get DUI's on there own street, if the keys are in the ignition, and your under the influence. It's a DUI plain and simple. Plus what really pisses people off, had this been a white man, you wouldn't even know his name, but because it's a black man shot by a white officer, his actions are dismissed and it's automatically the cops fault. I hope this officer Sue's the shit outta the city, and your a fool if you think he will get convicted. This man attacked these 2 cops, he literally punched them several times. He was going to prison had he gotten away. All on camera too."
292,294,I understand that he shouldn't have resisted arrest and was driving drunk. I know he took their taser. But I still don't think they needed to shoot the man.
293,295,This time they had every right to. You run you could get shot. It's the law.
294,296,It very obvious CNN edited that entire video to make him out to be the bad guy and make it look like he was in the wrong she clearly said the video over 44 minutes long but they edited everything to make it shorter truth is this man posed no threat to them he complied with thier directives that they gave to him as well as comply to do a breathalyzer test as well even if he did run these cops to lazy to run after him they do all that training while going through the process to become a cop but at what point did he pose a threatg to himself or them??? He was never a threat but here is the media out to distort his image as the one who was in the wrong smh
295,297,Obviously they needed seal team to stop this drunk guy.
296,298,"This was not police brutality tho
However it was excessive force in the last 60 secs of the body cam"
297,299,"Dude they got him and tazed hil and they still fire their gun, WTF DUDE!! I told my family this and this is me if I was the Holy father I would make my self present to the human race and not sit back"
298,300,You forgot to show the part where he hit the cop in the face. And the part where he shot the taser at the cop. How convenient
299,301,"When the suspect turned around and pointed the taser at the officer; he could have hit the officer, thereby stunning him for a few seconds, which is long enough to grab his gun and kill him. I‚Äôm not saying this would have happened; but I‚Äôm saying it COULD have happened."
300,302,Where's the other body cam footage?
301,303,"Whoever says tasers are not a lethal weapon. 
The cops wouldn't be able to self-defense if they get immobilize with a taser, especially by a CRIMINAL. This is unacceptable."
302,304,"Why run? There is NO WAY he could have gotten away with it running...even if he got away? They had his car, they new who he was...he knew the cops had him...why run? It's always the same thing...they always try to run!"
303,305,"You have his car and information, why chase him and kill him ? Desclate the situation by seizing the car and arresting him at his place ."
304,306,"He got scared, when they tried to handcuff him.üòîüíî"
305,307,Here we go again.
306,308,"If you would be honest, show the part where he turned and fired the taser at the police, and that was the exact moment he was shot. I watched the beginning of the video where the officers were extremely polite and calling him sir. They spoke kindly to him. Nothing derogatory or racist. But think of the backlash those same officers would face if they had let him go and he killed someone while driving to his next destination as suggested by some. Would someone at CNN stop trying to stir up hatred long enough to realize what you are doing to our country? What exactly will you be king of when you win? Tell the whole story- not just the parts that suit your agenda."
307,309,Can somebody explain how 2cops cant contain a drunk man on the floor ill wait...
308,310,"I do feel bad that a guy got killed, but ive been busted before and even if i didnt grab the cops taser, if id have run they woulda shot me, im sure.  at that point, you cant run from the cops"
309,311,Brooks is 27?! He looks 45!
310,312,"There is an issue with deadly force being used unnecessarily in some cases.. The Tony timpa, Ethan saylor  cases illustrate it isn't necessarily racial. It seems to effect all shades. Usually people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds or with disabilities / vulnerabilities wrought through mental illness or addiction."
311,313,No way this cop gets convicted.
312,314,Everyone needs to understand that man has reason to fear being handcuffed he saw George Floyd who cooperated until he died. Problem is the police need to be trained they are peace officers and they need to train how to take down a man without gun. Two officers on one drunk man who just woke up should be able to take him down without a taser. Should be willing to chase him on foot and be in shape to run him out of breath. If police do not want to be physical and are too afraid that they always turn to their fire arm they should do something else.
313,315,HE RUNS AWAY YOU DEMON PIGS!
314,316,"Ah yes, the room temperature challenge."
315,317,This is another reason why cops should be trained on deescalating situational procedures and communication
316,318,"This is DOCTORED. Look at the full footage. They made the officers look bad on purpose. They were both extremely professional in the circumstances. Btw, how drunk do you have to be to FALL ASLEEP IN THE DRIVE-THRU? Do you want someone that drunk driving in your neighborhood? It shows a complete lack of respect for human life when you CHOSE to drive that drunk. He could have killed somebody just by his driving alone. Also, if you are so un-hinged that you would actually try to taze and officer then god knows what else you are capable of. This is nothing like George Floyd. Thanks for fanning the flames CNN, we know exactly what you are here to do. People are waking up."
317,319,"I look at my Country then I look at the UK.

The UK has a better way of handling these things. US has fallen way behind in law, I can't even consider thinking it's ok to drive next to an peace officers without feeling like this can go either way."
318,320,You're right Charles because having a cops Tazer is not being armedü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
319,321,But he took the taser. He shot it at the cops and what if he stunned the cop grabbed his gun and killed the cop. The cop was more than justified. The guy should have just complied.
320,322,They should‚Äôve bought him a cuppa coffee  ‚òïÔ∏è
321,323,Show the video of him shooting the taser at the cop
322,324,"My understanding is that now - other than before - we must let risking lives of our friends and family let drunk and drugged people avoid police custody if they preferer to go and potentially hurt someone ( since they resist arrest and even try to tease officer with stolen from him teaser than he can not think straight hence may hurt or kill the next person he face...can't ""he/she""?)"
323,325,"Looking for someone who tells me if I'm wrong, if YES explain why:
Well, if they killed him during the fight üëèüëèüëèperfect! i shut up but they didn't so what reason they had to chase him and shoot him in the back. He turned around and tried the taser? Okay but it's not deadly and it got a short range so if you have a brain why would you get so close to him? üôÑ....maybe an excuse to kill? ü§îAnd why shoot in the back? He got legs, arms, why 3 bullets in the back?ü§î, why not shoot in the air to scare him? Or why not use your damn taser(taser vs taser) ""be a man""(kiddingüòâ) They're trained right?, they're not you and me(we would both shoot at sightüòÇ) What do you have to say to defend that please tell me."
324,326,"He was restless, tired, whatever. He's falling asleep OK I get that, but the line was moving forward obviously, no other customer was blocked from getting service. He was moving forward in line. No criminal activity was taking place. Whose the Karen that called the cops on him? I bet the caller feels pretty guilty as well."
325,327,THE COPS ARE TAKING ORDERS FROM THE BUNKER
326,328,"Hey CNN, how about that clip where he took a taser and nearly incapacitated an officer"
327,329,People really just want to see the clip of him get fatally shot bruh smh
328,330,You cant sleep at my place of business ! Go home and sleep in your own damn house !!!
329,331,Got what he asked for
330,332,They had no right to handcuff him or arrest him even if he was drinking because he was parked and sleeping  he wasn‚Äôt driving
331,333,"This situation could have been avoided. Mr Brooks was very cooperative. He even suggested to walk home back to his family. But this cop wanted more, so he keep pressing him, to a point where he lost his life. Discharge from service is nothing. He should be tried for murder, justice has to he served"
332,334,he took the tazer (his nonlethal option) and shot it at the cop was he saposta throw a baton at him?
333,335,cnn needs to show the whole clip. This can be taken out of context in both ways.
334,336,I feel like the audio of the shots tell a lot. Shooting once at the guy would would be ok as he fired at police first but three times!?! Three times is shoot to kill and completely changes my viewpoint on this as being too much
335,337,"The dude should be charged with assaulting an officer, not killed"
336,338,Nothing to see hereü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. The officer did the best he could. It‚Äôs sad that this has to happen!
337,339,"well, if the taser had worked as it was supposed to, he wouldn't have been killed"
338,340,Y fight you did what you did pay the price then you get to go home
339,341,He probably thought that the officer was planning to take his costo card.
340,342,His foot was on the brake still he probably wasn‚Äôt sleep
341,343,Is it a crime to b sleeping in your car when u r drunk instead of driving?
342,344,I pray for his family but just comply people it‚Äôs easier than losing your life over something simple.
343,345,Those justifying this killing do not get it are the reason we can not move forward.
344,346,So in this situation someone called 911 because he's passed out in the drivethrough line.  Police arrive test him for sobriety.  Subject refused to complete the test.  The police are Aresting him for suspicion of intoxication.  During the arest subject starts to resist.  Police can no longer use a takedown hold.  Subject get a hold of a tazer starts to flee the area with a dangerous weapon.  While fleeing he aims the tazer at a officer in a threatening way.  As a last resort the officer shoots him.  That's self defense.
345,347,"Cops were right on this one. He swung at them and stole the taser and fired back at them. He made multiple bad decisions that night. 
Drinking and driving not having a plan, being alone, and trying to fight off the cops while drunk."
346,348,"I just like how CNN loves race bating. They just have to make sure you know it was a white officer and a black man. THIS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RACE! The guy was drunk, his story kept changing and he resisted arrest. The cops were nice, courteous and would of treated anybody the same way.  Not sure how this could be the cops fault. Resisting arrest should be a topic for discussion. Do you know what would of happened if the let this guy go and he would of hit and killed someone with his car? The cops would then be liable because they knew he was drunk."
347,349,The guy deserved what he got. Police are humans too and they need to protect themselves
348,350,"With all that's happening,  the election will have to be moved. We are in an emergency situation."
349,351,"Rayshard Brooks had been serving a sentence for beating his own kids. He was released early on parole due to the mayor‚Äôs COVID-19 response. He served only months of a 5 year sentence. The man got a second chance. What did he do? He passed out drunk in his car in a drive thru. He knew if he was arrested that this would be a parole violation and he would go back to prison. He made his choice to drink and drive, which could‚Äôve killed innocent people itself. He chose to resist arrest. He chose to attack the officers. He chose to run from the scene. He chose to use a weapon against the arresting officers. Seems to me that this man made a lot of choices that resulted in this outcome. You can thank the mayor of Atlanta for allowing this man back in to society. It‚Äôs also ironic to hear the Fulton County DA refer to the police using tasers against ‚Äúpeaceful protesters‚Äù a couple of weeks ago as deadly force. But when a policeman is attacked with a taser, all of a sudden deadly force against a taser is unjustified. The democrats own the education system, the media, Hollywood, Big Tech and administrative government. If there is systematic racism or oppression, it‚Äôs at the feet of democrats. Lifelong democrat politicians who never did anything to improve the lives of their constituents, only to pander with the race card every time election season rolls around should be a wake up call for all to see the true hypocrisy that exists within the democrat party. Don‚Äôt get me starting on the Political Action Committee of BLM, a Shell Company for Act Blue, who‚Äôs sole objective is to raise money for and to help get democrats elected. It‚Äôs all an attempted partisan power grab."
350,352,"This overall was just a bad situation, it was very unfortunate"
351,353,This is beyond any comprehension. He was compliant and was not endangering anybody‚Äôs life. Why use such deadly force?
352,354,In our country they dont shoot you in this type of situation they beat you up and make you realize that this was a bad idea
353,355,nobody should comply with armed thugs
354,356,"The guy was a thug. Driving while intoxicated, resisting arrest, stealing the cops taser and firing at him. The cop had every right to defend himself. And they are trying to give him the death penatly. I hope the cop wins"
355,357,"The officers got there ass wooped.
That's why the cop killed him ."
356,358,"that does not look a racial issue to me.

If I did this to my local police officer, I would get shot for sure."
357,359,How about you show the video where Brooks shoots the cops face point blank when struggling on the ground? They only show him running away and shooting but not the first.
358,360,Police need to be given more effective non-lethal weapons. If all you have after your taser for defence is a pistol then guess what comes out next when the drunk guy is shooting your taser at you.
359,361,Maybe he knows what happens after he gets cuffed.
360,362,"The guy fired a taser at the police. At that point, you‚Äôre in the wrong, buddy."
361,363,The guy was fully cooperating and then the police officers came IN to enforce the power. He was drunk but  not the police officers and must not be killed. PERIOD. Or just ban the bars.
362,364,Now i know the reason why i was never hired as a police officer.
363,365,Show the part where the teaser gun was stolen from the police and pointing at them!  Do it!
364,366,"‚ÄúIn fear of imminent to your life or the life of another to use deadly force.‚Äù All cops should know that. We took the same test before going into law enforcement. Common sense and a heart is what‚Äôs lacking. What clouds these cops minds are power behind the uniform and their guns. Their true characters shows. No one used their heads, sad a life is gone."
365,367,"Cops these days...""Don't Comply you gonna Die. period"""
366,368,"That guy showed clear intent to harm the officers and acted on it. He fired the taser at the officer, which he could have done again potential disabling the officer, at which point he could have also taken the officers gun and use it to kill the officer. Its 100% justify. If you disagree let me punch a few times in the face grave a taser and fire it at you and then you can tell me if you felt fear for your life or not. That is exactly what this guy did."
367,369,"Let me get this straight he fell asleep in a parking lot of Wendy's ü§î,,and the breath test show he was drunkü§î
This is my intake he did the right thing by sleeping it off instead of being on the road really oh but he was black is that the case he did nothing wrong but play this safeüòí"
368,370,"Yo got no idea what yo was doing, and it happened to be a bro in law enforcement.
Blaim the evolution, things happened as they were."
369,371,You never said he took the taser
370,372,If he wouldve done what he was dupposed to do he would still be alive.  He brought this on himself
371,373,He asked him twice to pull over... the first time he fell back asleep so the officer went back to the car and told him again. Show the whole video. üòí
372,374,#fightback
373,375,Why can't you show the whole video or the other videos? You guys show small clip with somebody talkin over it giving you their narrative and trying to tell you how to think and feel about it. Here's a link to a video bet shows multiple videos of what happened you can turn off the sound and not listen to The Narrative and still figure out what's going on. 
374,376,You shouldn't resist ever. This one i'm not supporting. He shot at cops and resisted arrest. He was drunk as hell and we need to stop normalizing this in the community.
375,377,"While they could have let him run, impound his car and try to catch him at his home address. I have a whole lot less compassion for people picking fights with the police, wrestling their weapons from them, to avoid getting arrested for drunk driving."
376,378,"He should of took an Uber! This is super sad however I don‚Äôt know if I was drinking and driving they would lock my ass up too... I am not sure if they should of shot him; I am not a police officer but maybe I would shot someone if I had too. I don‚Äôt like how the news is twisting all this around,  honestly I don‚Äôt know what to believe... I am not driving drunk üòµ in the future tho"
377,379,"Should of been DUI resisting arrest and if u wanna stack the books felony assault may even be able to sprinkle with a deadly weapon, it should not be a death sentence. And if 2 cops can‚Äôt subdue 1 drunk man I really think they need more physical training"
378,380,I wonder if there‚Äôs going to be footage showing the cops are telling truth or that they shot an unarmed man just for running
379,381,you see a cop on the ground
380,382,"And this is the attitude of so many ....shoot someone if they‚Äôve done you wrong....if someone runs away  with your wallet/purse do you shoot them?
How you answer determines what side of humanity  you really are on .....
Awful ...and another example of why we need complete overhaul of the justice system"
381,383,The BROTHER WAS STRONG AS HELL . HE GOT AWAY FROM TWO PIGS .
382,384,What if the taser he fired back incapacitated the office and the suspect came back and got possession of his gun
383,385,Why was the officer fired?
384,386,How about giving all the facts for once CNN? Waste of time watching anything you guys say.
385,387,I‚Äôm done watching the news..
386,388,Oh so it's clear then from begining he resist arrest...if he just comply he will still be alive today! Simple thing but sometimes people like to make it difficult! There's consequences.
387,389,He pointed less then lethal weapon at the cop and got shot twice in the back...‚Ä¶...
388,390,"This footage tells a fuller story: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnRuWcgflaE"
389,391,"I don't know how many have seen this story on CNN. But the cars moved after rayshard was shot once. The same officer proceeded to walk  his way to Rayshard Brooks, still living body, and shot him in the back again."
390,392,"This guy is being naive. In the moment the cops don‚Äôt actually know what he has in his hand. They just had an aggressive perpetrator in a fight with two policemen. He points something at them and they fire at him. If they hesitated, it could have been one of them."
391,393,"Why did it need two officer's from behind to cuff him, is that US Police protocol. That was a critical mistake. One officer should be in front of Mr Brooks to read his eyes and body language and talking to Mr Brooks at all times. That would of reduced the chance of a fight and flight by Mr Brooks. The rest that followed after that would not of happened. The officer's were guilty of being caught by surprise by Mr Brooks, losing a scuffle, losing a tazer, running after Mr Brooks and then shooting him. This was all so avoidable! Poor police practice was evident here. UK Police are taught to back away from any situation that might otherwise escalate and to not feel that they have to ""win"" every possible or probable confrontation. A police officers best weapon is their mouth. Where was the greater reasonableness, proportionality and the greater emphasis on considering every other option by these two officers? "
392,394,"So point made,the right to shoot was not with the officers. The suspect blew a 1.08, and did not have a weapon... A taser is not a lethal weapon nor does it require the police to escalate the situation into a shoot out. They had the right to detain him whether it be with less than lethal or a k9 unit after he got crazy with them albeit. But as the police chief said, at no point was there a imminent danger to the life of the officers or a bystander. Add it all together, cop is justified up until the point he opened fire, and should be charged appropriately like any citizen would be as it was an unnecessary use of force."
393,395,Th officers should be brought up on charges they patted him down he had no weapons he wasnt a danger to himself or others the police had no right to shoot him and kill him smh. The police need new training why when they guy who shot the ppl at church was not shot? Seems like the police see a Black person and forgets we are human too
394,396,this isn't the full video... in the fun video you can see and hear him chase him and shoot him.
395,397,a less deadly way let the drunk man run away impound the send by mail a large fine and court date.
396,398,No mention of the guy taking the cops taser and shooting it at him
397,399,Reparations should be paid out of the police retirement fund
398,400,where is your story on the 19 year old killed during the chop protests??????? that family deserves the truth to be out
399,401,"everybody wanted to go home after that incident, so sad. On this day resisting arrest would be the stupid thing to do, i dont understand why he did."
400,402,"it true, you cant be using deadly force like your give out candy."
401,403,"This guy doesn‚Äôt mention the perp took the taser and while he was running away turned around and pointed it at the officer.... all this guy had to do was go to jail, sleep it off and he would still be alive today. It‚Äôs his own fault"
402,404,"Even if he had a gun, why do they shoot at him? Why can‚Äôt they run after him or just let him go? They have his car there to get his identification so that they can deal with him later.  How sick is the mind of police to think they can just shoot someone because a person did not subject to them?!?! Sick!"
403,405,"Is this expert on drugs? ""they patted him down so they knew he was unarmed"" did he miss the part where the guy stole a taser...."
404,406,How many warnings did the guy get?
405,407,OH YES WE HAVE EDITED TO OUR LIKING TO ONLY SHOW THE NARRATIVE THAT WILL INCITE RACISM
406,408,I agree with everyone's posts.just wish cops acted like they do in England.2 cops..1drunk guy..you can take him without killing him.hire officers all 6 '7 like before and just laugh when they call you sextet or discrimotory1
407,409,"Let's apply a bit of logic: guy runs, so what. I have your car, your registration, apparently there's these things called kom-pu-tahs that can find your  address too! 
I mean in reality, these cops have removed a Tax Producing unit, and deprived the state of juicy juicy fines for resisting arrest, fleeing a scene etc! Oh the lost revenues!! Idiot cops! Could've milked more out of his corpse!"
408,410,Police never learn .... just shut  them down
409,411,Yet no one calls out the fact the dude punched the cop in the face  ?
410,412,"Cops: He's drunk and running away with a lethal taser, quick we're in imminent danger of him..Quick shot in the back!!!"
411,413,"good thing cops got the real video ,  give the cop a trip to Disney World and a shrink."
412,414,Unreal ... let him run away tow the car.  Don‚Äôt shoot!  Wtf !!!
413,415,"CNN you have to stop this you can‚Äôt take a 44 min video and condense it into a 2 min clip????
You wonder why people pick on you let‚Äôs get the whole video out just to be sure"
414,416,"National Enquirer>CNN
It's a sad world when a tabloid magazine has more credibility than a world wide news outlet and yet people are dumb enough to follow. How can any of these journalists or news anchors seriously go home without thinking, ""man, this is really fucked up what we just did."""
415,417,"He ran and aimed a weapon to the police. what if he had a small gun hidden in his pocket?
Police did the right thing first of all he should never take away weapon from a policeman."
416,418,"Clearly, the cop is going to prison ."
417,419,Wait a fucking minute - they get him to drive then arrest him for driving?!
418,420,"I don't care what they show us, the man was asleep in his car. 
They have no business talking to him beyond checking if he's dead or alive. 
Once he woke up, they should have left without him having to open his door."
419,421,"So, we really not gonna hold this man accountable for ANY of HIS actions that lead to the shooting? EVERYTHING is on the police officers? It's okay for him to act the way he acted, but, regardless of that, they should have made sure he was safe? I don't think the police did anything wrong. If he cooperates fully, he's still alive...the police isn't forced to react."
420,422,They had a reason to shoot him during the fight but they had no reason to chase him and shoot him down since they had his ID. It's not self defense if you chase and kill a person who's in possession of a non lethal weapon while you have a gun.
421,423,"The real problem is two police officers should of been able to overpower him and subdue him. Instead they lost their tazer in the fight, and he did try to use it against them.

So The question is, ""Does Avoiding getting hit by a Tazer in a hostile situation warrant the use of daedly force?"""
422,424,I do feel like they are making it worse
423,425,"Why they stopped him or even bothered him in the first place??
Why is it necessary to take his life"
424,426,Two messes running into each-other.
425,427,In more civilized countries we use actual scientific tests to determine whether someone is drunk or not. Making people do humiliating 'exercises' is ridiculous. And this guy gets shot because of it. Human life deserves more respect.
426,428,"I understand that the cop wasn‚Äôt necessarily exhibiting racism and had a reason to defend himself, but why not shoot the man in the leg or shoulder? The taser was clearly fired and missed prior to the officer shooting so it wasn‚Äôt really a weapon at that point anyways."
427,429,Lol I‚Äôm black...okay and by all means disagree with the training those 2 cops lacked use of to detain him/arrest him. BUT why in the HELL would you even risk death ...black or white it wasn‚Äôt a smart move even under the influence...both sides are arguably wrong tbh but hey your actions sometimes have immediate outcomes/ consequences and really that‚Äôs life.
428,430,How you know that wasn't a 3d print gun looking like a taser
429,431,üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•üò•
430,432,How does two officers lose  video simultaneously. Coz they both did lose records. Is this the new tech of getting rid of evidence?
431,433,Dood was drunk ass hell I've seen whole video hell he didn't even know where he was
432,434,lol they probably cut it short cause explained why the officers were in the right
433,435,Can't wait to see this guy 8th grade graduation picture.  Maybe his kindergarten teacher will come out and talk about he was such a good boy and show his finger paintings.
434,436,If you have 1000 volts of electricity being fired what do you do
435,437,Time to bring charges on CNN.
436,438,Damn first thing they do is bring up the race. Can‚Äôt we just watch the video and make that observation for ourselves?
437,439,"IF RAYSHARD WOUL HAVE NOT RESISTED  HE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY. BUT HE DECIDED TO FIGHT THE COPS AND TAKE AN OFFICER'S WEAPON AND AIM AND SHOOT THE OFFICER. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A TASER. CRIMINALS GET WHAT THEY DESERVE!! BLUE LIVES MATTERS, ALWAYS."
438,440,The cop should not use his gun bc his life was not in danger..period! He should wait and get him in a different ways !!!
439,441,Its fine to have him do the test for being drunk but arresting him is optional aslong as he doesnt drive home under the infualmce you already should habe recorded his info. Plus you already know he is not armed so  there is no need to use your weapon.and incase you say well you cant be sure if he lied or not well if you arnt sure they can always frisk to make sure aslong as they explain why they firsking.
440,442,Why they didn‚Äôt say that the guy teased the cop
441,443,Ok CNN you edited the video. Mr. Brooks gained control of the Officer‚Äôs taser and pointed said taser at the Officers. Bad situation that got worse.
442,444,Lot of missing footage ...
443,445,"So I guess you're not gonna show the video where he pins one of the cops down, or where he punches one in the face, or where he tries to reach for their gun but gets the taser instead. During the struggle, how does one cop know from the other if he took their gun. And when he fires the taser, AT NIGHT mind you and a spark shoots out. Should the cop ask him if he's shooting a gun or a taser first before he defends himself? NO, instead he saw a spark and shot him to protect himself and his partner. All of this could have been avoided had he complied, possibly would have gotten public intoxication and gotten out the next day. I'm sorry but this was NOT racial or police brutality. George Floyd, YES, police brutality and racial. Ahmaud Arbery, YES, clearly racial."
444,446,Could have just let the guy call someone to pick him up r tell him to uber
445,447,"CNN , show the full video"
446,448,"The cop shouldn't go to prison, yeah he could of solved this without his weapon, but shit happens in the heat of the moment. Yeah he dodged that taser and the guy probably planned to keep running until he got away. This same shit happened last weekend where the cop actually got hit by a taser, but they never killed the guy. Not everybody will respond the same."
447,449,what if the drunk guy that took the cops taser actually hit the cop with the taser and he runs and grabs the gun and shoots the cop or an innocent stander?  If he is drunk and grabs a taser what makes ppl think he won't grab the gun?
448,450,Why couldn't he just remain asleep in the parking lot until he sobered up? Wasn't like he was driving 100 on the opposite side of the highway.
449,451,"So let's say a guy fights and runs. Can law enforcement be held liable for not stopping him from running if he commits additional crimes?

So they let him run and he kills someone in a car accident trying to get away. Sure he didn't meant to but just let him go?"
450,452,Patting someone down doesn‚Äôt do anything if they steal your taser 2:00
451,453,Whoever called the cops talking bout son sleeping needs to get klap
452,454,Cop deserves to be fired for not being professional enough to handle the situation without lethal force.  On the flip this guy resisted arrest and stole the officers taser and attempted to use it on the officer.  This will never result in a murder conviction and is not a good case to try and use to advance a police brutality agenda
453,455,I thought the protest will be done by this week! Thank you officer for your chance
454,456,1. Don't drink and drive. 2. Don't point any weapon at the police.
455,457,"‚Äú he‚Äôs not in possession of a firearm so he cant hurt you ‚Äú 
proceeds to grab taser (yes the taser is non-lethal but if he tases the officer then he could take the officers gun could he not ? )"
456,458,You don't have the right to kill a drunk person
457,459,I wonder why everyone is protesting against cops ü§î
458,460,Why show only the bodycam though? There is an entire part that's missing. The part where the man tries shooting an officer with a stolen taser.
459,461,"Well, one thing is for certain, he wasn't that drunk if he overpowered and managed to take a Tazer from and outrun TWO cops. That man was not drunk.  Not forgiving his actions, but it could have been handled differently.  This did not require getting shot in the back three times simply because he was outrunning you; the man had no deadly weapons on him."
460,462,"As tragic as this is
Why was Wendys set alight???"
461,463,When you steal a Cops Taser and attempt to shoot a Cop with a Taser you get Hot Lead Injections.
462,464,Sad story of a brother lose his life because the police mad Rayshard making them work for their pay that day. He made them seem weak in front of the line of people and they shot him for showing outü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßêü§êüò¨
463,465,He took BOTH of the teasers and fired one upon the Police. The media lies abot this fact until it¬¥s a blatant farce.
464,466,Erik Killmonger : The world took everything away from me! Everything I ever loved! But I'ma make sure we're even. I've waited my whole life for this. The world's going to start over. I'MA BURN IT ALL!
465,467,Edited to make you think different they should‚Äôve just let that man run it was only a DUI
466,468,DRUNK DRIVING VICTIMS ITS TIME TO RALLY!
467,469,"That‚Äôs on him , he should have never ran. would of spent a night in jail and went about his day . Y‚Äôall make it hard by running."
468,470,Wtf how did this guy watch this video and see a completely 180 degree reversal of what any logical person would see
469,471,"Why resist arrest? If you are innocent, sort it out at the jail! People think, oh I'm going to get physical, and they will let me go?! Stupid!!"
470,472,They literally removed the clip of when the guy grabbed one of the cops tasers and fired it
471,473,Should have just aimed at the leg. Cant blame the officers though.
472,474,Brooks acted out in a way that resulted in his death.
473,475,It‚Äôs going to be reasonable force
474,476,Those cops should be fired and face murder charges.
475,477,He should've complied and the police shouldn't have used a damn gun in that kind of situation.. period
476,478,They skip the part where he tried to run and they just started talking about the struggle lol.
477,479,"Since Ramsey took the taser, is it possible that he could shoot the officer, stun him, then go back and get his gun and do something more?  While that could be possible, since there were two officers, it makes it difficult to understand why they officers had to use deadly force in the moment. BLM! However, we need to also give officers that risk their lives to protect us everyday the opportunity to hear their story as well.  Also, must say that this guy also did not have to get shot if he didn‚Äôt run and take the taser from the officer. What was he thinking?!"
478,480,What happen if the teaser hits the officer in the eyes???
479,481,POLICE LIVES MATTER
480,482,The cop should have just let him go?
481,483,I seen this onda news üò° He got shot 2times inda back when he tried too run ..
482,484,But the man wasnt even driving.  =(
483,485,The only thing I got from this video is that he tried to run away when he got caught. I feel like anyone who does that literally should‚Äôve been aborted
484,486,"The Chief mentions the protocol for when deadly forced is authorized via policy, that stems from Tennessee v. Garner if you want to read up on it. All he had was 1 shot of the officers own taser, should not have escalated to the point it did. It was a bad shooting (per policy) which is why it was a clear cut case for the police to have him turn in his badge and face charges."
485,487,So cops couldnt handle a drunk guy sleeping in his car without shooting him. Looks like they spent too much time training to kill and not enough time on hand-to-hand and grappling skills.
486,488,Stop trying to blame cops for everything
487,489,Officers need to be trained better. Once he ran no one was in danger....no reason to shoot.
488,490,What's crazy about this is he told the cops the situation where he was at where he going and why he there. He even said he could walk home. Cop put him in the back seat take him home like my god!!! He even told the cop about his daughters now there fatherless...sad sad sad
489,491,Then why resist arrest?
490,492,HE STOLE THE TASER! Why would you leave that out??
491,493,"I see a lot of people saying stuff like, ‚Äù he took the taser, so he deserved it.‚Äù Granted that was not a smart move. But something in a lot of police shootings is that it seems like officers always shoot to kill. Never to disarm."
492,494,seeing the comments for this video gives me hope for humanity.
493,495,"In my country these drunkers kill a lot of innocent including children, still i that this happen that ended up with the death of a human being but punishment for drunkers needs to be regulate or more innocents will die."
494,496,failed to show him running from the police  after he took a tazer gun  and shooting it at the police officers
495,497,‚ÄúYou have to be in fear of your life of the life of others before you use deadly force‚Äù? Apparently not if the suspect is a black man.
496,498,"The cop was justified, I feel sorry for people who think otherwise. They think they can assault cops, take their taser and point and shoot it at them. If y'all think that, y'all gonna take these types of L' s  every time. The guy would of set in jail till he was sobered and let go for a court date."
497,499,"You Run, you get shoot, periot."
498,500,"The wild shooting by the cop endangered  MANY innocent people. Cop was too quick to shoot, should not only have been fired, but also arrested."
499,501,Trump 2020
500,502,Taser: a non-lethal weapon that‚Äôs used to incapacitate someone. Vs. A gun: a weapon that has the potential to Maime/kill someone. So I‚Äôm not understanding how people are gonna try and defend this when it was a dui but as soon as he runs away the gun is pulled out
501,503,He went from Fairly Cooperative to Beast mode very Quickly no one should be shot it the Back...yet would be interested what his toxicology results were?
502,504,Don't blame Police. If they did their duty people would say they did it all wrong. The cops might as well just resign. Hard to keep law and order when you have no backup from your employers.
503,505,If that  cop just stood there got out his notepad and brainstormed some ideas this wouldn't happen.
504,506,Our whole country is in turmoil from the issue in Minneapolis. Let the suspect go as he runs away! Who care! Have his car impounded. He had no weapons! This is just fueling the fire! Bad judgment call on the officer! THINK!
505,507,"This is why CNN's so called ""law enforcement expert"" no longer works in law enforcemenent."
506,508,"Cops with no face masks or gloves again, as with George Floyd? Nothing strikes folks as odd there?"
507,509,Because he stole the cops taser then fled about a couple yards away then turned around and pointed the Taser at the Officer and then the officer fired three shots
508,510,"Èªí‰∫∫„Å†„Åã„Çâ„Å£„Å¶‰Ωï„Åó„Å¶„ÇÇË®Ä„ÅÑË®≥„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„ÅÑ„ÄÇ

509,511,Not justified to use deadly force.
510,512,"So he flees, he lives another day for you to catch him and bring him to justice.

You shoot, so that he doesn't flee and catch him dead. What good justice is this?"
511,513,Cops just need a tranquilizer gun put em to sleep ask questions later make it real easy
512,514,Show the other video where the victim assaults the other police officers repeatedly just before he steals a taser. The victim then aims a taser back towards the police officer and other bystanders.... the police officers had full right to use deadly Force.
513,515,Do we really need to keep watching these snuff films to get it?
514,516,"‚ÄúYou have to be in fear of your life before you use deadly force‚Äù


Aight fam need we say more?"
515,517,Don't break the law. You won't get shot. Pretty simple.
516,518,Its fear
517,519,All cops should walk off their jobs.  Their lives are more important than the media and B.S.
518,520,Why cop didnt shot his leg??
519,521,Dogs with guns. Shit.ü§¢ instead of one drunk run away. One dead man!
520,522,Everyone seem a bit trigger happy over there.
521,523,How do you have 10m subscribers but only -200k views?
522,524,"If he was in Wendy‚Äôs drive thru, what was the point of checking his person? They could of simply told him that he‚Äôs  drunk and that he either needs to call for a ride home or stay the night in his car at the Wendy‚Äôs until he sobers up. Why were they trying to arrest him if he wasn‚Äôt even on the road driving?"
523,525,"Some comments are saying that the level of force that  the police are shown to use in this video is ' legit'  IT WAS NOT! Those police had NO REASON to shoot/kill an unarmed, frightened, drunk guy who was simply trying to run away from them! 'Resisting arrest' is NOT, and should not BE, a death penalty legal offense! I'm not saying that fighting the cops was the right thing to do. I'm saying that we hage to be able to trust that men and women on the police force will be more calm, more level headed, better behaved, and more aware of/accountable to the law than the people who they are policing."
524,526,so intoxicated he passed out at the Wendys drive through lol
525,527,Want all this to end QUIT BRRAKING THE LAW!!!
526,528,"This man fought police officers trying to avoid getting arrested for drunk driving, he tried to taze a police officer and got shot for this, this guy was an idiot"
527,529,What did the alkasenzer read before they attempt to cuff Mr Brooks?
528,530,So he was supposed to be arrested for the few meters he drove on a parking lot that the police officers told him to? Is that a trick how to get a reason to arrest?
529,531,"The guy overpowered two officers, took a taser, and fired it at an officer. Let's say the police follow the CNN example, don't use deadly force. Guy runs, deploys taser on cop #1. Cop#2 is now alone. Seeing as both cops couldn't subdue him, what's to say cop #2 is also subdued, a weapon acquired, and an officer killed? He already showed belligerence and intent to resist. Had he simply ran, he wouldn't be dead. Had he simply ran, he would not be dead. But because he grabbed the taser and deployed it, he poses imminent danger to the officers, lethal force was justified"
530,532,üïØÔ∏èüôèüèºüïØÔ∏è
531,533,Why run. This is why people get shot. When a cop said something just do it. Fight about it later
532,534,OMG
533,535,That guy assaulted a police officer with a tazzer he took from the police officer
534,536,"What is the media doing? He literally tried to fight them and take their taser away. Then, he tried to tase them. What are they suppose to do..."
535,537,I guess the cops should have let the drunk drive home.
536,538,"Don‚Äôt resist arrest it‚Äôs that simple,if you do there‚Äôs not going to be a good out come !"
537,539,"Most of our phones are NOT WORKING for basic calls here in Atlanta.....
Anyone else experiencing this ???"
538,540,Let him run u have his car and all his info... dude is running away not toward the police
539,541,Video leak police....you can see the entire thing
540,542,It's all about respect. Brooks had ZERO respect.
541,543,"Save time on training and new regulations and all this run around........ NEW LAW if you assault a police officer, you show intention to incapacitate,,,,,,,,a police officer is a mobile weapons rack, if you  assault them you show intent to have access to their weapons. OFFICER has full authotrity to use deadly force to stop your access to those weapons......if that is LAW and EVERYONE in USA has KNOWLEDGE OF THIS LAW.....how many assaults on COPS will happen???...........KISS Keep It Simple Stupid........Not medicene to treat,,,,,,eradicate the disease"
542,544,Shit here we go again. WAVE 2
543,545,The police is justified in this case
544,546,"Why shoot? He had no weapon. Their lives weren't in danger.  Even if the police got hit by a taser that they used to try to calm a irrational person down (which will do the complete opposite)  doesn't make sense. This is why we need to train officers for more than 7 months to be able to handle this situation. To prevent killing.  I understand if he was compliant this wouldn't most likely not happen.  However,  that man was drunk which means anything can happen and it's up to the training and critical thinking of the officer to descalate the situation as safely as possible because it's their job"
545,547,Waste of 2:48 seconds.
546,548,He wint for the cops gun
547,549,Where is the rest of tge footage ?
548,550,What i dont inderstand  taking the taser gun then  running AWAY FROM THEM why shoot him they had his information he didnt take it then turn to use it on them instead runs away
549,551,Here we go again ü§îü§îüòïüòï
550,552,he is on the run -  you have his car - where is he going? - I mean why shoot a gun at him?  Go ahead make up some reason because you already know he is unarmed. next time just go wait at the person's home.
551,553,So did both body cams fall off? Where is the footage from the camera that's not on the ground?
552,554,"I am Mad because he was being so polite and cooperative, and tell the police put the handcuffs on without saying anything to him , Ohh My God when is police going to stop killed the black men the in this Country üò• üò• , i spoke to my cousin today and he said to me Cous I'm scared for myself , Black men shouldn't have to feel like that."
553,555,"Lesson, don't drink and drive, fight and assault the cops, steal their weapons, and run. Nothing to see here, move along. And if the cop was shot and killed the MSM response......silence. But because a black man was killed breaking multiple laws, sudden outrage. All cops should walk off the job. It isn't worth it."
554,556,A tazer can kill of used improperly
555,557,"Basically two weak cops let a drunk man get the jump on them, get tased by their own taser, and then shot him in the back as he ran away. Out of humiliation I assume."
556,558,I wasn‚Äôt there but I think the officer should have offered him a ride home. Perhaps ask the driver to call for a ride and tow his car.  Just trying to arrest wasn‚Äôt the answer.  I understand he was drunk but he was not not diving at the time of incident (sleeping in the car).  God help us as a Nation!
557,559,Y did he try to run?
558,560,So why did the cop get fired? What did he do wrong?
559,561,"Oh, I just love how CNN cut off the Chief at exactly the right spot....."
560,562,"Ok, to help clarify what happened: yes he resisted arrest and took one of their tazers, attempted to flee and during that moment turned and possibly fired the tazer. Now, under their laws they CAN NOT use deadly force on suspects unless a life is in actual danger and not doing so would mean a loss of life. That he had their tazer does not clear the officers for the use of deadly force because a tazer is a non lethal device, And they patted him down and were about to cuff him  which suggests they felt comfortable he had no weapons on him before the tazer. "
561,563,‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è
562,564,"well,,,,he should not have given them a hard time...also he took the officers stun gun and tried shooting him with it! so his partner shot him..simple as that..he was far from innocent!"
563,565,Drunk driving kills.
564,566,Bad decisions meeting Bad Practice...
565,567,Why is the guy breaking the law always the victim
566,568,HELL NO AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!
567,569,It's not ok to shoot at someone that running from you point blank. You alone use the damn gun if your life is Threaten. They are wrong they should know how to handle this situation without using a gun. A teaser can also kill a person. The police department is doing but harm to the public damn how many people going to die in order to see some real change smh.
568,570,Play the full footage.
569,571,"If you resist arrest, you take a chance.  If you grab an officer‚Äôs weapon, you take a chance.  If you run away from officers who apprehended you, you take a chance.  If you aim a weapon at an officer, you take a chance.  When you do all 4, you‚Äôre flipping a coin as to whether you‚Äôll come out alive."
570,572,"Not to legitimize what the cops did to Ray, but George Floyd didn't have a chance. Rayshard had more of an opportunity to change the outcome."
571,573,"As a black person I don‚Äôt think this was race related at all, but I also don‚Äôt think the officer needed to fire at someone fleeing when 1. He was too far to be of a threat with a taser and 2. The officer could have shot him in a non lethal location."
572,574,Do we need to travel underground to feel safe.
573,575,How many times could he fire that taser? He missed.
574,576,Trigger  happy cops
575,577,He became armed when he took the officers taser.
576,578,Was the body camera paper clipped to the cop? It didn't take much to fall off his torso.
577,579,Clean kill.
578,580,Yeah but with adrenaline shit happens
579,581,HE SHOT THE TASER AT THE COP IF IT HIT THE COP THE COP WOULD OF BEEN UNABLE TO MOVE FOR ABOUT 18 TO 30 SECONDS  AND THEN THE CRIMINAL COULD OF JUST HIT THE TRIGGER AGAIN AND COULD OF DONE THE SAME THING 18 TIMES BEFORE  THAT TASER RUNS OUT. iN THE MEAN TIME THE COPS GUN IS ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY AND HE JUST TOOK A TASER OFF HIM . THIS IS A GOOD SHOOT. SORRY THE GUY SEEMED LIKE A NICE GUY BUT MADE BAD DECISIONS
580,582,The media is killing this country‚Äôs soul.
581,583,"They should change the song to ""Good Boys Good Boys what you gonna do? What you gonna do when they come for you?"
582,584,How many times can you fire that taser just curious
583,585,There was no need for him to run. He would've been home with his family maybe with a DUI and his life
584,586,Here we go again
585,587,"I‚Äôm about tired of y‚Äôall defending the police and acting like you really believe they are scared for their lives. Let‚Äôs remember that hundreds of professionals have to deal with crazy and sometimes violent persons daily. Could you imagine a nurse unloading a magazine on a patient who wouldn‚Äôt lay down? Seems extreme doesn‚Äôt it? The same goes for mental health counselors, therapist and FBI agents"
586,588,my opinion on this matter just took a 180.

589,591,"The law enforcement should be disarmed of mortal weapons. They can keep the Baton, flashlight, pepper spray, and taser. No guns whatsoever that way at least it's fair when multiple cops surround you"
590,592,In know way shape or form should the officer used deadly force but... all coulda been avoided if dude just compliedü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Rip tho man smh
591,593,I BLAME CNN FOR THIS
592,594,This on call for justice n reality need to balance they level like foreally naw
593,595,Cnn really does try to twist everything
594,596,His fault for resisting.... but shooting him for it? hell they had his car... and even some car chases ....cops will forego if there is a danger... but we can't let a drunk go ...
595,597,"Resist arrest, fight two officers on ground, take taser and point it at police. Wonder why he got shot?"
596,598,Just like the news. Cut the film edit it. Then show to the public. 40 min video we'll show the camera on the ground.
597,599,"We all are free to choose our sins,  not the consequences  of those sins."
598,600,"Police officers are not screened and trained properly in the states.I live in Canada and it is too difficult to become a police officer here, therefore Canada ranks second best police forces global-wise after Japan."
599,601,"If he gets away, you have his car and identity. Put a warrant out for his arrest. Don‚Äôt stop his life because he is running from you. Cops are too proud and bloodthirsty to let an unarmed man run away and try to arrest him later."
600,602,Why doesn‚Äôt cnn show the entire video of the police giving him a sobriety test and talking him nicely and the reason which led to his arrest. Deceptive editing.
601,603,nice 45 second video cnn!
602,604,Why it's  important to notify by media about skin color ?Is it racism or instigation?
603,605,The dudes asleep in a drive thru line. Wtf
604,606,A darn mess.
605,607,Remember...this is CNN...making there own truth!!
606,608,"He reaped what he sowed, plain as that. The cops should sue the city for wrongful termination. Anyone making excuses for this man should be embarrassed of themselves. Why are criminals being martyred? This is a disgrace for anyone to do, just a rediculas narrative to stand by. Here's a thought, when you commit a crime own it. Dont fight police,  punch them in the face, steal their tazer and shoot it at them. What did he think would happen? Seriously? He got what he put in, that simple."
607,609,The police did what was right there is no debate in this.
608,610,"Nah, I got 4 kids. Black, white, red, green or blue. I‚Äôm going home tonight to my family and so would all of you, keep it at üíØ. Joker should of complied with the officer on this one. This is way different then Mr. Floyd. This had nothing to do with racism. Everything was going smooth until someone started acting like a ass!!!!"
609,611,Horror cops
610,612,CNN should be a shame.
611,613,"These were his options
his options were 
1) resist arrest
2) resist arrest and run"
612,614,Why is the camera looking up at the sky towards the end? Cop take it off???
613,615,It's sad to hear that this man was shot and killed by a police officer but at the same time do not put yourself in a situation to were u going to make it harder on yourself. Just corporate in the best way that u can and don't give any police officers a reason to take out their guns.
614,616,"CNN trying to spin the fact. 
I still don‚Äôt understand why he tried to run away then grabbed the taser and points it at the cops."
615,617,But the cops have his car....they should have just waited for him to come back for his car....or just impound the car and either pick him up at his house or when he goes to retrieve his car..
616,618,"It was a short ranged non lethal taser againt officers with armor. The taser missed and it only has 1 shot. So they coulda tased him (the partner whos taser wasnt taken) and apprehended him. The shooting was unjustified as the suspect didnt have  a ""weapon"" to use against the officers in that momemnt anymore."
617,619,Excessive force from the police for no reason.  He shouldn't have been killed because he was drunk and took a taser. PERIOD!!!!!!!!
618,620,I support black lives matter but even i can understand that this was the black guys fault. Not the cop
619,621,"The taser wasnt the cops who opened fire because he still had his but as this muppet has turned and fired at the cops i question whether the cop was aware it was his partners taser. Course we could find out if it had been investigated before sacking the cop. Why did the chief resign, was it in defence of the cop? Cops need to strike and give the public a taste of life without Police."
620,622,Why do police officer kill someone when he is not armed?!? Trying to run from the police is a death sentence in the state? WTH is wrong with you guys?
621,623,"He was in drive thru at wendys, why was he detained again, random dui check?"
622,624,Umm looks good to me respect to the dead but he ran
623,625,Iam Latino and we know if you drink and drive and get busted. you have to do the time when you do the crime. Why was rayshard fighting and running??? Just take the arrest and get out the drunk tank tomorrow.
624,626,Justified.
625,627,"What we dont see here: rayshard running AWAY from the cops and getting hit from behind.
This was a murderer."
626,628,"At this stage, they have his car and licence, let him run and increase the penalty!"
627,629,"If you treat humans as if their life is insignificant, 
you are denying that God made us all.

If you fall for the divide and conquer crap, you're not paying attention."
628,630,Any violation under influence should not be charged under court of law . Maybe deserved a citation . Unless if he/she commit a serious crime. DUI is a very serious charge will completely destroy his life so he rather tried to run instead but he left the entire world just like that. So painful to watch. #Blacklifematter
629,631,I‚Äôm all for the movement but I‚Äôm sorry this guy should not be used as an example of criminal justice reform. The dude clearly resisted and tussled with the cops on the floor shot the taser at them.  You can try and spin this however you want saying but he was running away yadayadayada. That dude would‚Äôve gotten capped in any country around the world no question. He was wrong and the movement needs to keep its focus on unjust murders.
630,632,Man I got a job. Ain't even gonna protest this one. You shouldn't assault cops and steal a taser
631,633,Dude woke up drunk in his car and out wrestled two cops just like that.  Why did he fight? Were the cops supposed to think he wasn't dangerous after he defeated both of them? Bad choice to defend this gaper passed out in the drive through little mercy... much pity.
632,634,"Lazy they didn‚Äôt want to run .. they knew he was unarmed. Even if you tussle its not proper to use excess to subdue a person, those ‚Äúrights‚Äù are going to change, more tasers (unfortunate) for longer reach but firing on a person for a little bit of alcohol is abuse . Death in this case. The alcohol laws are going to change now that we have let weed/ganja/marijuana rules change, laws should and due change according to the times, these laws here, even officers are going to change, better social economic change are going to too"
633,635,Justified
634,636,Justified
635,637,"Your lying again, didn't show the whole thing where suspect assaults officer-punches officer and takes taser, fights both officers,
and even looks like suspect tried to tase officer. Perhaps you want to  promote more riots. Lousy journalism and you should"
636,638,Justified
637,639,"The guy was clearly in the wrong. What I can‚Äôt quite understand in all of these cases is why do the cops seem to shoot to kill. Surely it would make more sense to just mame someone?  This doesn‚Äôt seem to show all aspects of footage available elsewhere which does show him resisting then fighting the officers, taking their taser and firing it at one of them, so yeh, it‚Äôs a whole lot of bad choices yet again by both sides but this on the face of things isn‚Äôt a racially based event."
638,640,"Um. He was  drinking and driving.  He could've ran and not try and take the gun. Moreover,  he discharged it. He was being reckless."
639,641,"‚ÄúIt was discharged during the foot chase but you know he is unarmed.....‚Äù HE STOLE THE COPS TAZER AND DISCHARGED IT AT THE COP..... NIGHTY NIGHT! As far as I‚Äôm concerned, he forfeit his life right there.... justified shooting..."
640,642,"maybe when officers begin to detain you, you shouldn‚Äôt run away, steal their taser, and fire it at them"
641,643,I agree he should not have done any of that with the police But that does not equal to a death sentence. You can still live on after being tased but you probably won‚Äôt make it after being shot by a gun
642,644,Resisting arrest and running and pointing taser gun at police not gonna end well. So sry for the live lost.
643,645,I think I saw Brooks punching the officer in a video. Anyone else see that vid?...
644,646,Shorten 45 minutes into about 1 minute sure
645,647,Unjustified killing.!
646,648,"Suggestion : People should not be murdered for falling victim to a physiological response (fight or flight) - 
How about we add an additional fine to adults who run from the police.. maybe $1k. Which will be paid by the suspect.. if there is proper picture ID.  Let them run, offer a rewards for info.. once that person is arrested. Be fine pay the rewards, & collect fine from suspect... By either garnishing wages, levying their accounts, taxes.. etc... But it's okay if that person isn't an immediate deadly threat to people around him/her."
647,649,"The pat down for weapons didn't look very through.  The officer at that point didn't believe he was armed, however weapons are sometimes missed.  The struggle ensued & the taser was taken from the Officer.  Charges went quickly from suspected DUI,  to Resisting Arrest,  Simple Assault, to a forcible felony of Strong Arm Robbery when the Taser was taken, Theft of the Taser, Aggravated Assault by pointing & Firing at the Officer.  The Taser when fired by the fleeing felon, is the first shot heard and seen.  It sounds just like a firearm when discharged.  The Officer then discharged his weapon.  Put yourself in the Officers shoes, would you be in fear for your life in those split seconds and at that point.  Does the Officer have to engage in another struggle with him and possibly have his gun taken and used on him?  There was nothing racist about this incident.  Watch the 43 minute Officers camera.  The force continuem scale went from one end to the other, with deadly force being used against a forcible fleeing felon."
648,650,so..why no footage of him walking and failing the sobriety test? if that's what he was arrested for..why not show it? unless...there is not such a thing.
649,651,"So it's right for the police to shoot and kill you if you're drunk and try to run away? Hmm what a world... I don't see a problem in Letting him run away, he leaves his car behind, he has to come get it."
650,652,He ran from police then shot the taser at police pretty dumb that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt run
651,653,"Someone please insert a skyrim ""Hey your finally awake"" meme"
652,654,"So, if I run away I'm going to get shot at? With a lethal weapon? Wow."
653,655,"Not for nothing,  but if he hadn't fought the cops, he would be alive."
654,656,shortened? so mayve needed footage to understand is cut out?
655,657,He grabbed one of the tasers and shot it at the police officer. They don‚Äôt show you that
656,658,Driving under influence????? That guy is sleeping. WTF????????
657,659,the cop was wrong but do what the cop tell you too do he was drunk jail is much better then dead
658,660,"One more done, too many of those to go."
659,661,Stealing a taser is still no reason to kill a Person
660,662,He stole the freakin taser!
661,663,He lost focus.
662,664,There r done.. do u have a weapon... no .. Pat's him down.. nothing .. and still shoots him
663,665,"CNN: aghh lets see how can we make the cops look racist? 
CNN Editor: I gotchu"
664,666,"I used to like CNN up until today. YOU SUPPOSED TO DELIVER FACTS, WHATS THE POINT OF THIS VIDEO? FOR VIEWS? FOR MORE CONFLICTS? WHY BOTHERS TO SHOW PART OF THE CLIPS WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN THE FULL VIDEO? SHAME ON YOU CNN!"
665,667,"When someone is driving while intoxicated, fighting police officers, running and firing a taser at the officer in pursuit, he was an imminent threat to the officers, the public, and himself before he stepped out of his vehicle."
666,668,Still no reason to shoot a man with a taser that is drunk
667,669,The police were justified the person escalated the violence and pointed and fired a weapon at the police.the police were justified in returning fire
668,670,Imagine being a cop and getting overpowered by a drunk dude who just woke up. They should be fired just for that
669,671,well i understand if they shot him in a non vital spot like the feet or shoulder but they basically executed him
670,672,ohh irak needs freedoom and democracy
671,673,"Some shootings are just hate and unprovoked.  But most of these cop shootings involved some kind of struggle and running away.  Brooks struggled and fight his way including grabbing the police taser.   Even if Brooks is patted down and has no weapon on him.  Once he stole the taser, he can use it on the officer and then grab his gun.    Travon Martin also fought and tried to grab the gun away.   In the video, George Floyd also resisted and struggled with the police several moments before being kneed to death..  But these has a cause and effect, despite its overuse of force.  It may be the police force policy or training that made cops do this when the suspect is not complying."
672,674,Still haven't learnt anything over there
673,675,"Hey CNN...As usual..Only your narrative..Why are you not showing the footage where the drunk dude grabbed the taser in the fight,then turned & point at the officer while he was running,which made him become a threat.Noooo,can't show that that cause then the officer wouldn't be 100% at fault...I believe there is enough blame for that tragedy to go around in the incident."
674,676,If the police did there job rather than shoot someone as if they are a full fledged terrorist then this martyr synopsis would not even be a thing. Maybe instead of pointing out the kind of person he was- we need to examine why police are shooting someone because they are too lazy to apprehend him later when he goes home. Very simple however people make it complicated because there is no common sense.
675,677,so no comment about him stealing and FIRING a taser at the officer. please don't leave out details to push a narrative it's unprofessional.
676,678,Blair Witch Project looks a lot different from what I remember.
677,679,"The guy resisted arrest, fought with both Officers, punched one in the face, stole the Officers taser then turned around to tase the Officer which if it hit him the Black guy could have taken the Cops gun so , the Cop shoots him..SELF DEFENSE BABY....If that idiot would have let those Officers put the cuffs on him he would still be alive."
678,680,"next time don't try to escape, don't take the taser gun from a police officer."
679,681,"Resists arrest, assaults police, steals weapon, fires weapon at officer, officer shoots...nothing to see here."
680,682,Also they had his car.. let him run and catch him later.. you don't have to shoot and kill like that
681,683,"Does anyone have statistics for police shootings, with death rates? They seem (I could be wrong) that they appear to be shoot (multiple times) to kill? Does anyone end up with just a minor injury?"
682,684,"Police should learn to shoot to live, not to die. One shot I. The leg maybe? Not multiple to the body"
683,685,MNOGO ME JE POGODIO OVAJ KLIP. NEMOGU DA VERUJEM DA POLICIJA MOZE BITI OVOLIKO  BRUTALNA. KOLOIKO SAM RAZUMELA COVEK JE SPAVAO U KOLIMA A STA SE POSLE DESILO NISAM RAZUMELA.PREVODITE I NA SRPSKI DA ZNAMO O CEMU SE RADI.
684,686,A taser is a deadly weapon to police. Tase a cop he goes down and you can take his gun... And he only fired a taser because he missed grabbing the officers service weapon. The cop was justified in shooting this man. But that does not excuse the fact that with proper Jiu Jitsu training the officers could have apprehended him without taking his life. We need to make the cops learn Jiu Jitsu I cannot stress this enough.
685,687,The police lawyers are going to try to make up some fake dangers he thinks that cop or both were in.
686,688,"So Brooks CHOSES  to flee because he was getting cuffed up for being intoxicated, took an officers taser and tried to stun the officer. Was a kill shot needed, probably not, but Brooks ultimately made a choice. The police were very civil about everything, even when when attempting to cuff up. I have been cuffed up for posession and for the most part, if follow orders, there is nothing to worry about. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time."
687,689,Is there a chance Jusse Smollett is somehow involved with this?
688,690,"Why didn't they just .....""Ok sir..let's leave the car here for now and get you an Uber home"".....problem solved?"
689,691,"I'm a huge supporter of the defund the police movement, but this was clearly not police brutality Rayshard completely messed up. should he have died no and it's unfortunate but this is not the same as Goerge Floyd and I hope the movement doesn't stick to its guns on this on when there is clear evidence of police brutality elsewhere."
690,692,Seems legit to me!
691,693,"I'm so sorry for this man. Being drunk and resisting arrest is not a reason to get shot. That being said: you have the guy's car and patted him down. 

Police: LET HIM RUN. He was gonna get caught. Follow him around on your car to prevent him from getting hurt or something. It's amateur hour with the police."
692,694,@YouTube How do I flag this video as propaganda?
693,695,WTF !!??
694,696,How do u go from a DUI to being shot dead. And what the #* is a pain compliance technique way to much use of the word compliance in the English language. What happened here complying with killing... What is going on  that was a human being
695,697,"2 Wrongs Dont Make A Right.
He Was Wrong For Resisting Arrest BUT The Officer Was wrong for using deadly force"
696,698,Resisting arrest. The sentence is death. Carried out by police on the street.

702,704,Why did he resist?
703,705,Again no matter what this shouldn't happen
704,706,Y'all wanna mention how he stole a cops taser? No? That would paint him in a bad way? Like he's a criminal with a criminal background and warrants? And yet the cop lost his job for doing HIS JOB. This country is on fire and all we care about is skin color
705,707,"VladTV has the 2 hour body cam on his channel this early morning, CNN you‚Äôre getting slow"

707,709,"I don‚Äôt get it, why would this man try to run?"
708,710,"These police brutality and excessive force encounters are not isolated incidents. They happen because of poor and or incorrect training.  Gezz, reform cops from top to bottom !  Protests will not stop until cops behave professionally... more like military police !"
709,711,Once again the cop conveniently has removed his body cam.
710,712,cops love losing their jobs..smh
711,713,"Everyone saying that footage is missing thinking this is a conspiracy, the title literally says body cam footage. This isn't a compilation of all the videos."
712,714,How do u is shoot someone  unharmed  and running? How‚Äôs he threatening u? It‚Äôs not police it‚Äôs the black kill squad
713,715,Stop burning buildings and go get the person that you see accountable.
714,716,"Shot a man while running, that is not legal! Shot an officer with a non lethal weapon, doesn't deserve to get shot from the back. Different scenario, guy gets away, COPS have his license plates, most likely drivers license, a warrant would have been issued. Man still lives! Justice for ALL!"
715,717,NOBODY NOTICE @ 1:46 THE COP FINGERS/HAND OVER THE BODY CAM AS HE TAKES IT OFF?
716,718,"Hey Look i'm a fairly liberal democrat ...but, Why did he Fight and Run ? .. Did he really think he could get away with a DUI ?  My brother got a DUI sitting in a parked car listening to the radio in front of my house .."

719,721,"Thinking like a cop, I have padded the guy down, he's giving excuses not to be arrested. There is a tussle when you try to cuff him. Why not have him sit on the curb?? A guy running away, even with a taser is not a threat to me. He got a gun and he's running not  shooting? Different scenario."
720,722,"Too many overweight, trigger-happy people in law enforcement."
721,723,"Pathetic training for these two. They cannot restrain a single short and slender man. But most importantly if you shoot several times at someone who is running away from you - it is a murder. No matter what happened before. Tasers are not lethal and only fire once. And what if he runs? Big deal, you have his details you can run after him, fire warning shots, whatever. Absolutely no sense of taking his life."
722,724,Honestly it's a shame that those police officers weren't hospitalized ....or buried in a cemetery
723,725,"Here in Kenya, we are doing better. We thought america was the super power, its shameful. In Kenya a policeman would bundle a drunk driver in the police car and drive him to the station, then take his car to the nearest police station. no bullets fired to an 'intoxicated' man."
724,726,Why didn't you show where the guy shot at the police with the Taser. And if the Taser hit the officer the guy could have got the police officer gun. Then he could be armed. Yes the police could used less of  Lethal measures but he couldn't. Because most of them are used in Closet  up matters. The police was trained to hit sente
725,727,Why did the cop pull off his body cam?
726,728,I think people should start protesting these networks.  They really think people are that stupid.

732,734,"They had no right to arrest him for sleeping in his car. How many times white boys do the same thing and they take the keys and have someone come pick him up. Secondly, it was a taser, I don't agree with him snatching and firing, but he must have been mentally anguished and scared. Two wrongs does not make it right. He did not have a gun, they could have shoot to injure!"
733,735,üòíüôÑ
734,736,Of course CNN is not going to go the extra mile and show where this guy took the officer's tazer and tried to use it on the cop
735,737,When does this ever end?
736,738,Shot in the back twice.the cops knew who he was.cant let it go and arrest him later? So the cop shoots a father of 4 down like a dog. What value do we as Americans put on human life?  Why couldn't family be called to just take him home? And sort it out later? There is a better way to handle the situation.

745,747,Umm..... Where's the rest of the clip... Did someone edit where he punched the cop stole the taser ran off pointed and fired at the cop....

762,764,You don't mention the Officer had to wake him up on three occasions.
763,765,I am black but he did resist and take the taser gun... the officers seem to be  following protocol...but when he ran away they shot him in the back...they could hv just shot to injure not to kill
764,766,None of the people in this video are wearing masks or social distancing.
765,767,I can‚Äôt believe this is getting so much attention he stole an officers taser and tried to shoot him with it some kills are good
766,768,What they dont show u is him taking there tazer and aiming at the officer but ok
767,769,What's the purpose for showing this video to the public? Don't fall for it
768,770,Yes but who usually has a gun and how  many people are licensed holder.
769,771,a taser is not lethal UNLESS the man tases you and then takes your gun while you are stunned. then it becomes lethal.
770,772,Let me just drop my body camera üëÆ
771,773,What a load of crap I don't still don't think the cop did anything wrong if he had been hit with the taser the guy could have took his gun
772,774,They have his car let the guy run away and catch him later ü§∑
773,775,"Here's the thing. THIS CASE ISN'T A RACE THING SO DON'T MAKE IT A RACE THING! They were responding to a drunken guy and went to arrest him. While he was being arrested, he resisted arrest, stole the officers taser, ran away, and than fired the taser at the cops. For a concern for HIS AND OTHERS WELL BEING, he shot at the man. Reasonable cause. You can argue if he should of shot but this has nothing to due with race"
774,776,Im against racism but It was self defense.
775,777,CNN I can't believe how manipulative you're being.... wow
776,778,"The one thing I wanted to see was, did the officers get his info, like a drivers licence? If so, and did you see his car? Not an old piece of crap, so after the scuffle and the chase begins, if he`s so dangerous with a Taser then stop the pursuit, tow his car, pay him a visit the next day, arrest him for DUI, resisting arrest, assaulting an officer, stealing a Taser, he`s gonna go down big time, NO NEED TO SHOOT AND KILL."
777,779,"The critical point is not the what happens in the video but how people behave in a stressful situation because every such killing is starting from the one an only point - disobedience to the police. It‚Äôs not like a Black man was walking doing nothing and they just shot him even before he turns his head in their direction. All who were shot were this or that way refusing to be arrested. On the other side no one, even the police officers, said that they are people and are afraid when the situation from peaceful going to danger and their adrenalin uncontrollably going up, the heart starts pumping more blood into the veins for the burst of energy, the brain is frantically searching the unconscious mind sorting thousands of previous situations for the reaction and action to protect their life or just from a harm. "
778,780,Sucks to be arrested but dang dude u can't point any weapon at a cop that's a givin.
779,781,Wtf if he would stun them both he could have take their guns and kill them.. ofc they shot him
780,782,"‚ÄúNow you pat him down, now you know he‚Äôs not in possession of a firearm.‚Äù
Wrong.
1) A field pat down isn‚Äôt a thorough search. Isn‚Äôt a 100% guarantee of no firearm.
2) There are always at least as many firearms on scene as police officers. If he was willing to grab a taser and use it against police, he could be willing to use a firearm he takes."
781,783,Known criminal and child abuser dies. It isnt a tragedy. There fixed title
782,784,"I'm googling ""8 year old girl shot in Atlanta CNN"".  This is the video coverage."
783,785,Sad.
784,786,"Why did suspect resist,  take the tasor, aim the tasor at officers.  This turned ugly when suspect resisted arrest. That seems to be left out  on most news channel?  This is much different than George Floyd case, where it was blatant brutality ."
785,787,The truth is that they just dont feel like running.
786,788,trump needs to resign for things to go back to Normal
787,789,That‚Äôs murder point Blank period
788,790,Why not shoot on leg or safe place
789,791,"Legal limit in Atlanta Ga is .08 so he was legally drunk. Why did he run? Maybe he had a warrant, suspended license? Stolen vehicle? If not, why run?"
790,792,HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAA
791,793,Why won't these police officers learn?.
792,794,He didn't have to shoot... he was running away he was not a threat at any time in the video
793,795,Ok so what part of I‚Äôm not armed don‚Äôt u get ! ?
794,796,This clip did not clarify anything?
795,797,"Second wave of protest, I mean LOOTING .."
796,798,If you don‚Äôt resist arrest and assault cops then nothing bad happens in this case....just a night sleeping it off in the drunk tank.
797,799,"Legit, find something else to race bait with CNN"
798,800,This case has nothing to with race.
799,801,Ok so that guy needed to get shot
800,802,It‚Äôs really about race. If the cops were black this wouldn‚Äôt even be a story.
801,803,"Orig unedited footage showed a lot more. Multiple falling asleep cycles, him driving, hitting the curb & driving backwards, different versions of why he was there, amongst other things. After the scuffle, he ran, turned, & fired at the officer BEFORE the officer returned fire. Justified? Idk."
802,804,"Another brother shot in the back while running away smmfh!?.... The LORD will avenge innocent blood shed of His people"" Joel3:21(NIV) and if you look at the earth HE is not a lair according to MATTHEW24! Anybody with any sense is focused on salvation so regardless if devils like these coming knocking on your door you already got the victory etherway it go!! Love Blessing and Strength to the family of the victim!! "
803,805,Why did the camera come off? should they be redesigned to stay on better? Or was it removed just beforehand intentionally?
804,806,What üò≥ if we ü§î kissed üòò at the ruins üèö of Wendy's üçîüçü
805,807,Later On they burned down Wendy‚Äôs for the killing
806,808,One less rioter
807,809,"I cant believe people are actually trying to defend that lunatic, he literally resisted arrest fought the cops and stole their weapon and attempted to use it against them not only that it's all caught on video! Like wth has this world come to, it disgust me to think that one of these cops got fired when he should of been given a medal for chasing an out of control maniac with a weapon  and stoping the threat"
808,810,"Apearantly CNN is as bad as the prosecutor office at ""losing"" footage. What happened to the footage of dude throwing and landing punches on officers?"
809,811,they really showed those wendys
810,812,"I have an idea, don‚Äôt fight the police"
811,813,Why hasnt CNN mentioned the 3 year old black boy that got shot??
812,814,Why not let him run and pick him up at his house the day after!?
813,815,"unnecessary death, police's problem"
814,816,Defund cnn o wait who owns cnn??
815,817,This is so sad...They know who he is and were he lives..Did they have to shoot him..rip
816,818,"Is it a must to get him at that moment, I don't get it. If you want to get a guy who is not armed with weapons and he is not a fugitive or has previous serious issues to answer for. If he flees, do you have to kill him.. Can't you get him later or is there more to all this. So if some someone flees from police unarmed and has not killed an officer, just resisting arrest warrants been shot and killed. It doesn't make sense.. I can't understand."
817,819,Do they train people on the hood to resist  arrest? And take a weapon? And run? And point stuff at cops? WTF.   It‚Äôs not a target he got shot.   He was stupid
818,820,Suprised CNN didn't blame it on covid..
819,821,"By policy alone its justified. This isn't the first time someone has been shot for taking a cops tazer. Don't blame the officer, advocate for policy change... like trumps police reform"
820,822,"Germany:
--> Suspicion of driver being drunk
--> Police makes a test
--> Driver fails it"
821,823,"A taser is not deadly force
They could have arrested him later"
822,824,The cop could've let him sleep in his car.

825,827,"They leave out the part that he took a cops tazer, tazed him, then after fighting with the cops, while running away, fire the tazer at the other cop.

Do you know how you don't get shot in a wendy's parking lot when you're passed out drunk? Don't fight with the cops, then taze them."
826,828,Cnn are you SERIOUSSSS
827,829,"He was drinking and driving. He resisted arrest, and stole a taser and shot it at police. This was 100 percent justified. They call him a good father but he got charged for cruelty to children. He made some stupid decisions that night and it cost him his life."
828,830,I‚Äôm sympathetic but if he‚Äôd just complied he‚Äôd probably be leaving the drunk tank right now
829,831,Just let the man run and add to his charges. A taser is non-lethal and it didn't have much effect. It's not worth killing someone over. This is the problem with policing these days. It's like you have impunity to kill just because you were scared and then you can even lie about it and get off the hook.
830,832,Yeah he wasn‚Äôt in possession of a firearm but he stole a taser and ran then pointed it at a cop now he‚Äôs dead that‚Äôs what happens completely justified in my book
831,833,Who shot who?
832,834,For cops in USA it seems to look like the wild west for them. Someone starts throwing hands then they practice their quick draw with no hesitation. Its sad a 2v1 resulted in this. Prayers to the family
833,835,After she said white officer.  I stopped the vid.
834,836,"The officer was too focused on getting the arrest. The man was drunk and calm. So I think the officer didn't have to rush to arrest him. He tried to handcuff him in a few seconds. I feel this could've had a very safe outcome if the officer would've kept a calm pace and explain the the guy first, then arrest, just as he took time to explain and confirm about the breath test.  The man may have turned around by himself and surrendered."
835,837,The restaurant had better footage than the body cam. I wonder why CNN didnt wanna use that footage. Maybe cuz it shows the suspect turning and trying to use the taser on the police.
836,838,"Why hand cuffs,all over Europe they ticket you and toll the car,also when he was running they keep on tissing him why"
837,839,"Does it really matter what part of a video is shown to the public? It‚Äôs not the 1800‚Äôs we have a due process, killings need to stop. That simple. I realize a lot of people would like to see a horse thief hanged. But every officer, unless given no other option, should never have to kill someone. It just shows how life is valued in this country."
838,840,He shouldn‚Äôt have resist üòñ such a tragedy
839,841,Now we need to see if u grab an officer's taser and point that at him can an officer use deadly force to that i don't know
840,842,The officer got his feelings hurt in the scuffle so he shot Rayshard in the back. There..fixed it for you.
841,843,"Jesus Christ! I understand resisting arrest, but where was the second or third officer to assist in apprehending this guy??? It seems this shooting should've been completely unnecessary!"
842,844,In the first place the police not supposed arresting him he is on private property he's not on the main road
843,845,Now spect The CIVIL WAR
844,846,"Worst possible timing for this, like come on. That being said, cop should not be arrested or fired"
845,847,Cheers to the cop
846,848,When he took off running they didn‚Äôt have to shoot him in the back he‚Äôll they had his I‚Äôd it‚Äôs not like they didn‚Äôt know we‚Äôre he lived and who he was
847,849,"Let him run away,  he has no weapon  and police has his car.  Weird bunch of people , shooting people for petty issues."
848,850,Is it worth killing a man over not getting an arrest?
849,851,"Why did the cop try to make him look like a fool for a half hour?  He was from out of town, it's understandable that he didn't know exactly where he was.  Cop was making a joke of him.  Why did they grab him by the wrist?  Tell him to put his hands behind his back and see how he reacts before you get grabby.  I could tell that neither of the cops enjoy their work or even want to be on the job.  Why did the first cop ask Rayshard to drive to the parking spot?  That's just dumb.  Why did the cop ask him how much money he had?  That's just racist.  They would not have treated a white person like that.  They should have given him a ride to the hotel or called an Uber.  Would he have shot a white person in the back?  I don't think so."
850,852,They had his car that could be traced to him and an arrest could have been made later. The chase and shooting was absolutely unnecessary
851,853,"100 % justified. Cop did his job, not really well since the criminal got a taser. Good job Officer. Democrats think the cop is suppose to ask him to return to a safe space, lol. I guess the cop was suppose to get tazered, gun taken, and murdered? Thank you Officer, he's a HERO"
852,854,That was perhaps the most pointless use of narration EVER.
853,855,cnn think u ppl were born yesterday lmao
854,856,So why no protesting ?
855,857,"Thanks, CNN, for editing out when the guy fires at the cop with the Taser as he flees, and THEN is shot. Don't be fooled, people."
856,858,Rashard had no malice
857,859,Didn't want to get arrested for DUI
858,860,"Poor guy shouldn't have died, but all he had to do was comply and live to dispute it later,  I don't think most cops wake up in the morning,  go on duty and wonder,"" hhmmm, how many people can I kill today??""...."
859,861,"3 shots at an unarmed guy running away from you. Trumpets will argue ""but he had their taser""."
860,862,"Here‚Äôs a crazy idea, ok check this out I‚Äôve been thinking about it for quite awhile now...ok here it is. How about obey the law and if you break it then listen to an officers instructions while being detained or arrested üòÉ what do y‚Äôall think pretty crazy I knowü§™ But might work"
861,863,"Still can't believe people are calling him a ""Innocent man"". What? Driving around drunk is not enough to make you a criminal? Resisting arrest does not make a criminal? Beating on two officers of the law does not make you a criminal? Stealing a deadly weapon does not make you a criminal? SHOOTING deadly weapon at officers of the law does not make you a criminal? THEN WHAT DOES?"
862,864,my heart dies every time I see a young live extinguished in such a way ..on the other hand  why so difficult to comply with the law and react so violently ... no winners in this stupid circle of violence from both sides .hopeful all families involved can find some peace .. the media the only one to be blame time and time again
863,865,Guy assaulted the police and it is his fault he is dead
864,866,"If he was under the influence why wouldn't they let him run. They had his car and could identify him. Why kill. He fell asleep in his car. No weapons.  Another lost life. There is no coming back. Anyone think that death was necessary? What if it was your son, dad or brother. Would it be ok then? So sad"
865,867,"Your drunk
You stop
You sleep
Avoid accident"
866,868,How people are saying that the police shot him because he is black is absolutely mindblowing to me. They gave him 3 opportunities to pull into a parking space without a breathalyzer. Dude totally escalated the situation on his own.
867,869,"This police brutality has to stop.
They Got him to pull over, found he was intoxicated, how about taking his keys and have the vehicle impounded and get his info from his id and give him a citation to show up to court to deal with the dui. Why do we have to keep arresting people for the simplest things and then it turns up into a big thing. The laws and the way thing need to be handled needs to change."
868,870,A lot of discrimination going on and black people being hunted but this ain't it.  Not trying to sound heartless but this guy brought this on his self. What he did you just can't do.
869,871,I stand corrected if I am wrong but did that person not resist arrest and take an officers taser ?
870,872,"Everything appears to be okay, until the officer shot him in the back while he was running away. That part is not okay.  ‚öñÔ∏è‚úäüåª"
871,873,"If it involves cops, a tie DOESN'T  go to the runner..."
872,874,"it's pretty funny they demand self accountability from everyone except themselves.
March for another 60 years.
idiots"
873,875,Now you show me this?
874,876,.gov .gov .gov your local state has all their laws written down not hard to find them I'd rather take a charge than fight for some dumb BS.... Well whatever hundreds die a day from starvation but I guess this guy is so special...
875,877,Don‚Äôt run away when you‚Äôre getting arrested. Pretty simple really.
876,878,"Stop commiting crimes, its to bad we cant just speak the truth anymore."
877,879,Charles Ramsey?? Isn't that the guy who saved the girl who was kidnapped???
878,880,Can police not chase ...ok he shouldn't have fought back and ran but shoot ?? Too much shooting over nothing.
879,881,*Angry protest noises
880,882,"I‚Äôve struggled with this one... while it‚Äôs totally wrong the cop killed him, the dude should not have struggled and ran or shot a weapon at them... it‚Äôs tough..."
881,883,"In Europe things like that could not happen, here Police doesn't handle guns easily and had more respect for the life of people. One more thing if you shoot at the back of someone it's always a crime because there's not threat if someone is running away and unarmed. This officer was incompetent"
882,884,2:00
883,885,If the intoxicated guy tazed the cop correctly he could have taken his gun and killed him. This was Clear and Present Danger. #shameonAtlanta
884,886,Unbelievable....he was obviously intoxicated....he was obviously unarmed.....why the hen does he end up dead?  This needs to be reformed....these officers need to be trained properly on how to manage in a non violent way.  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
885,887,"You left out a lot. Firstly, they asked him to move TWICE. He actually went back to sleep after the first time then asked him."
886,888,"This dude should have just complied and should have let the cops arrest him. If he thought he was innocent he could have fought it in court. They only hold you for 8 hrs in the drunk tank, he could have just done his 8 hrs gone home and get a lawyer; instead he wound up dead which is sad. I pray that everyone decides to change and make the right choices for the sake of their own health and the health of others!!!"
887,889,"There is no way to justify fatality shooting a person tht runs away from you. T
He's not a threat. He's running away! Chase him down! This is murder! You are shooting somebody running away from you!!!"
888,890,He was sleeping under the influence not driving
889,891,You guys are manipulating the angle show the other angle
890,892,cnn never tells the whole story.
891,893,"Big fan of CNN however since maybe 3 years ago the channel has turned to shite , will it ever return to fact news I've no idea , I hope so but doubt it ."
892,894,"Why edit to show misleading viewpoint?
I'm a hardcore liberal, but it's like, don't shoot your own credibility by not providing full context."
893,895,Let‚Äôs stop condoning retaliation against our policemen. Let them do their job. Teach the kids how to behave in a respectful manner. Let‚Äôs not give criminals a pass for non- compliance.
894,896,You‚Äôre not telling the whole story CNN....
895,897,"Show the entire tape.. come on cnn.. just be honest, Seem like you guys like starting crap.. Just be honest"
896,898,the cops should have chase him or let him go and find him later.
897,899,so   i guess  we issue butterfly nets to police officers when dealing with black  suspects  assaulting police  and trying to flee the scene... i guess just have him go sleep it off come back and buy him breakfast .?accountability goes the other way too.this isnt george floyd
898,900,I thing I sow other video white guy wa running away and attack the a police and he never got shot wtf
899,901,It was murder.
900,902,How about shutting up and just showing the full video. This kind of deception should be illegal
901,903,"Here are the facts of the case that matter.

Fact: A taser is NOT a lethal weapon. 
Fact: A gun IS a lethal weapon. "
902,904,CNN never gives the whole story. This man chose a very bad path.
903,905,"I hear THREE shots... three, for an unarmed ""suspect"""
904,906,"All I want to know is , are they going to rebuild that Wendy's?"
905,907,GETTING KILLED CAUSE YOU DRIVING DRUNK. WTF üò¢
906,908,"The dude grabbed the cops taser and tried to fire it at him, sorry but the shooting was justified. If you think a taser is not lethal, you clearly don‚Äôt know the reason cops need to be trained to use them, or the fact that being shocked longer than 20 seconds with one can be result in a coma or death. Sure there was probably more that the cops could have done, but stealing a cops weapon and firing it at him is not what I would call a smart move either"
907,909,Put up the whole video not this edited crap
908,910,Im racist and I find this black ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
909,911,Media is eating this up
910,912,Why does he fight if he's innocent? If there is no case then be patient till you are free.
911,913,The guy thought they were about to put a foot on his neck and panicked
912,914,All this manipulation manipulated bs bs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
913,915,"Just terrible that lethal force was used. If he just wasn't drunk, blocked a business, failed a FST, resisted arrest, fought with them to get away, TOOK THE LEOs TASER, FIRED IT AT HIM while fleeing....none of this would have ever happened."
914,916,The guy was already running white shooting from behind no fair
915,917,He Was RESISTING BIG TIME. None of this would of happened  if only he cooperated and STAYED DOWN after getting tasered. Sad As it sounds its the guys fault. But I‚Äôm sure you guys are still going to push the agenda.
916,918,So now all attorneys are black to? lol come on man come on this is getting rediciulus
917,919,"I'm sorry but.. failed sobriety test, resisted arrest, stole a police weapon, attempted to use that weapon against the police. Shooting was justified but I hoped it didn't kill him.. just incapacitated him."
918,920,THis isnt the whole video.
919,921,"We have new videos! But because we're CNN, we're not showing you all of it"
920,922,"Don't drive drunk, assault police officers or attempt to steal their holstered licensed weapons ?
Dang. Wendy's got torched."
921,923,Condolences to Rayshard Brooks' family and friends. Police would have handled this differently if he'd been white. Mr Brooks' fought back out of fear. It cost him his life.
922,924,"On the show Cops they chased bad guys all the time. Whats the use of taking a fitness test as an officer if your just going to shoot an unarmed suspect anyways. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Badge, gun, and pension please. üõ°üî´üíµü§≤üèæ"
923,925,Is Atlanta going to burn down now
924,926,What again !!!!!!!!!!
925,927,He had no weapon he was running away why you have to kill him that's crazy another black man got murdered
926,928,A taster gun in the hands of someone who is DRUNK is a deadly weapon....
927,929,You have his car. You absolutely should have let him go. Get him later.
928,930,They could have avoid shooting. He can be caught later.
929,931,Don't drive drunk and resist arrest. Order a pizza.
930,932,l`m done............
931,933,America strikes again!
932,934,Trump 2020 !!!
933,935,Drunken man makes terrible decisions that cost him his life. Two cops became judge jury and executioner. Should the guy have assaulted the police? No. Should that be a death sentence? Absolutely not.
934,936,"Australia:
--> Suspicion of driver being drunk
--> Police makes a test
--> Driver fails it"
935,937,"That's a lot of editing, even for CNN"
936,938,Cnn why don‚Äôt you show the video where the guy goes to shoot the officer with the stun gun????????
937,939,"I don't care what people say
They start to cuff the guy, the guy struggles, takes the taser, runs, cops chase him, he tries to fire the taser at the cops
I mean you play stupid games and win stupid prizes"
938,940,"It was cringeworthy to hear this many lies come out of this guy's mouth.... 
Then stole a cops taser and shot it at them? Lethal or not, it could have ended up that way if he had struck the officer and then took his gun. "
939,941,"It is funny to me reading comments people are going at each other saying you black you white you brown you pink you yellow.
The problem is not with color or race problem is with the structure of our society gambling, alcohol, guns,prostitution, cannabis,high tax and interest rate broken families father's absent from child's life. I mean common and list go on and on iam not trying to preach but how you going to treat a disease with out finding a root cause of it."
940,942,"Couldn't the Police, if they were ""scared"" have shot to wound instead of shooting to kill?"
941,943,"Shooting a taser at someone is not (or should not) be grounds for shooting a gun back at you. However, in our current trigger happy, racist society where a black 8-9 year holding a brightly colored, orange and green squirt gun can lose his life to a white male cop on patrol who shoots and kills him, because ‚Äúhe mistook it for a real gun‚Äù this is to be expected. Cops need better training and the system needs to be dramatically reformed."
942,944,"There was nothing that justified the use of a gun.  If a police officer feared for his life after having his taser pointed at him, then perhaps they should not be pointing tasers as well no?  It was a DUI, no one should lose their life over a DUI.  I mean, if it comes down to it, let the moron run off, you'll eventually get him, you have HIS car.  Police need to learn more deescalation."
943,945,"I don‚Äôt care what color you are. You pull a stunt like that, you‚Äôre going to get shot and deservedly so. YOU CAN‚ÄôT DO THAT $HIT. It‚Äôs just bad parenting. This is what happens when everyone gets a trophy and there is no father around to kick a$$ when needed. It‚Äôs a tragic situation."
944,946,You're news. Stop shortening clips. Show it all
945,947,See those flashes? That's CNN editing the video.
946,948,He was not armed AND he was running away. He was no threat. They shot him in the back!!

950,952,This man was WRONG he was DUI and assaulted an officer. This is why body cams are so critical!!
951,953,"You know he isnot armed,because he said he is not?"
952,954,"Good job officers. They did their best and gave him every chance. He decided to violently resist arrest, swing at the cops, steal their taser, run away AND try to shoot the cop with the taser. He got what he asked for."
953,955,"If 2 officer can‚Äôt subdue an unarmed person. And just chose to shoot because them donuts didn‚Äôt help with their stamina....well they chose the wrong job. And yeah there should be justice here, use of deadly force when it‚Äôs not bit necessary."
954,956,Just do not resist arrest and you would not be shot
955,957,This shooting wasn't called for when all they had to do was issue a warrant for his arrest.
956,958,Well that was worthless commentary.
957,959,Umm call him a cab? Them no one gets hurt
958,960,CNN has shortened the video to fit their narrative.
959,961,"So strange that countries with no or less guns, and have equality don't have any killings"
960,962,I have one question did they have to shoot to kill could you not shot him in the leg
961,963,That is crazzzzzzzzzzzzY
962,964,I TOLD YOU COPS ARE OUT FOR BLOOD.(MORE THAN AVERAGE)
963,965,"Changing

964,966,Quit making excuses for some ones stupidity he should have listened
965,967,Didn‚Äôt the man steal and use a taser on an officer? Show the rest of the damn video.
966,968,Where is the video or this thg is the video
967,969,"If two cops cannot handle one guy, they are in a wrong profession. And why shoot him in the first place? He was just driving while drunk. Even if he fled, shouldn't they at least try some other means on capturing him that shooting?"
968,970,They don't even show it..... Other videos do so get Real News somewhere else....
969,971,Watch a different vid not on cnn there leavin our the video on why he got shot which is justified
970,972,The police were in the right
971,973,They need to teach to not resist arrest in schools.  This is what can happen when people are stupid.
972,974,What's Alan Sugar doing on here..??
973,975,Ridiculous reporting
974,976,"Let it be noted that everyone who believes this cop was right is giving their consent for their  son to be shot in the back , if  God forbid,  they're ever in this situation!!  So we got it now!!"
975,977,"Yea so if he had tazed the office and incapacitated him..... apparently  a bad shot, when he fired it at the cop ....that guy could have done anything to him he wanted...including taking the cops gun etc,    This is BS !!!"
976,978,"Okay okay... He was being compliant. He was unarmed. Up to the point where he was being arrested (for an infraction that didn't require you to be arrested, just send him home) he did everything right. I don't know why he was running away, but killing him was just plain stupid."
977,979,"Say this dude landed that taser on the cop and knocked him out. Now the cop is helpless to be beaten to death by this guy. He was not unarmed and he was clearly acting dangerous. CNN, I am blaming you for all this hate between people right now cause you are doing all you can to keep this going for your own agenda."
978,980,To say he's not armed is just a joke! He grabbed the stun gun and shot it at the cops. He has a weapon that he STOLE  from the police.  There is another video where he shoots it at the police then aims it at onlookers. He was a threat to society! This was justified!
979,981,Nice edit there CNN....typical.

No the cop kept it going, blow into this yes no yes no. Trying to show he's the boss. "
989,991,"Died over a DUI, fighting cops, resisting arrest, taking a cops weapon, and attempting to use it against him. Anyone regardless of skin color increases their odds of getting shot if they follow that path."

Who knows he could have then grabbed a piece of wood and knocked one of them cops or anyone else in the head, he coud have hyjacked a car, he could have used anything around him since he was bent enough to get away that he shot the stun gun.

1008,1010,"First off,you don't resist arrest,second,you don't take a police officers taser,3rd you don't flee from the police..How can police officers do their job correctly when they are being arrested for doing exactly what they were trained to do.."
1009,1011,"Can you blame him for trying to run away, he thought they'd George Floyd him"
1010,1012,Dude was sleeping in his car. Dude stood perfectly upright through the whole interview and tried to be honest and tell them he had one and a half margaritas which is nothing for a man his size. If the police are so worried about safety go after the Millions of mindless drivers staring at their stupid phones. These cops were hunting. Policing is Big Business and they still need our tax money.
1011,1013,Welcome to USA

1014,1016,Less than Lethal does not mean Non-Lethal. There's a reason this term is used. The quack should go back to his basement.

1016,1018,They should have left him alone. He was sleeping in his car.
1017,1019,I dont take CNN seriously
1018,1020,Jewish police officer is the question?
1019,1021,The editors of this video conveniently left out the part where the suspect turned around shot the officer with the taser he took from the officer which is why his ass got killed in the 1st place.  Nice going CNN with your sorry ass reporting.
1020,1022,"Police needs Rubber bulets... They are not humans, how to take life of person, Who run.."
1021,1023,we can see that they are looking fir any reasen to keel the black peipme ...
1022,1024,"If the Cop really believes he is drunk, why don't they think he fought them under influence and let him run away since they got his ID, they have more than million ways of chatting him. He may even turn him self in when he is back to his senses. Is a person worth dying while trying to run away from you?"
1023,1025,man feared hi$ life... getting $hot for being drunk lol amerikkka
1024,1026,Nobody seemed to watch the 2007 video by Chris Rock-How not to get your ass kicked by the police. Does that make Chris racist nowadays? I‚Äôm confused how this works...
1025,1027,Why can't the police shoot in the arms or legs. Why shoot too kill IF they are not armed?? Explain!!
1026,1028,be that unreasonable and unkind and the arrogance of that police officer could have let him e=walk home hell gave him a ride home let him call someone to come pick him up.... I wonder how many jobs that father held down to be that tired ? I did not know in this day and age police officers performed their duties in this way...just because of your skin and your culture.
1027,1029,"Didn't realize you can't sleep in your car in America.  Only sidewalks and streets,it's ok to sleep ( homeless)?"
1028,1030,Fake news! He points something at the officer first! They are not showing this!
1029,1031,Hey CNN show the part where the guy assaults 2 police officers takes one of their weapons and uses it against them....
1030,1032,"Honestly, I blame the media for all this mess...they are the ones segregating."
1031,1033,He wasn't driving he was asleep... Scum criminal cop's...
1032,1034,Anyone that believes the Police were in the right hit that like button I‚Äôm trying to see how many clueless people watched this
1033,1035,"Isn‚Äôt shooting someone in the back manslaughter? I‚Äôm confused, the man pointed the taser at the cop and shot yes, but he was running.. so there was no way he would of came back to the cops to grab their weapons because he was in a flight state.. I don‚Äôt get it."
1034,1036,"You shot and killed someone in cold blood from behind while they're running away just because they were slightly impaired?  WTF?!?!

There's a name for this, it's called first degree murder!!  I'm ashamed to have ever been a police officer.  There's way more criminals wearing blue than I had ever imagined...wow."
1035,1037,Fully justified. ‚úä
1036,1038,Why resist arrest? It‚Äôs shit like that is what gets you shot. I‚Äôm sorry but this guy put himself in a bad situation.
1037,1039,"good ,if he let the officer do his job the fuckin idiot would be home tonight,why dide he make things difficult.tuff"
1038,1040,Of course they didn‚Äôt show the full video. Terrible reporting to accomplish a goal.
1039,1041,White troll haven in here right now. Eeew.
1040,1042,"damn cnn, show the real angle"
1041,1043,Holy shit...this is by far the worst angles from the footage they have..weird. I would suggest people who have only seen this garbage go find a better version.
1042,1044,Well if he was kicking the police ass he could've possibly grabbed the gun. He was a man ready to die like so many more out there get over it
1043,1045,"So the guy was driving drunk, resists arrest, steals a taser, runs from the police, shoots them with the taser, and somehow they're the bad guys for shooting him?"
1044,1046,Tennessee Vs. Garner.
1045,1047,Don't resist arrest putting lives in danger & yours!
1046,1048,"For what it‚Äôs worth . . . Let‚Äôs be honest.  Firing his gun was wrong.  But, right up to that moment, these cops did a good job, and were very patient.  It‚Äôs always that moment, when they try to cuff the perp, where is goes horrible.  Countless videos show you, always that moment.  They NEED some clever, self adjusting cuffs, that go on real easy.  That would save countless lives.  But, let me ask people?"
1047,1049,MAYBE DONT RUN FROM THE POLICE IF YOU DONT WANNA GET SHOT. OMFG WHO ARE DUPID HERE
1048,1050,How is this still happening! Disgraceful
1049,1051,"Why they had to call the cops for such a thing , just talk to the car see what‚Äôs going on and ask him to move"
1050,1052,"If I did what this guy did, I‚Äôd be expecting a bullet in me."
1051,1053,"Why are non violent Crimes that have not harmed anyone end up with the suspect in cuffs and dragged off to jail. The Police had his Identity, his Car and he was co-operating. Write the guy a ticket, tow his car and call him a Taxi to get him Home safely. The man did not have to die and the Cops overplayed the situation by a long shot."
1052,1054,How are these guys cops? And why are they not trained
1053,1055,"I dont get all this. He got what he deserved. How dumb does someone gotta be to steal a cops taser, resist arrest, run, and try and shoot the cop with his taser? Then people protest this and burn down the wendys. This is beyond stupid"
1054,1056,"What do you want the world to think about you, America?"
1055,1057,"And the first question is, if this had been a drunk white guy, would he have been shot?  And the second question is, why the hell did anybody have to get shot?"
1056,1058,So what did Wendy‚Äôs do?
1057,1059,To All Trump Supporters making derogatory comments about CNN. Go watch Fox News. Your problem is solved.
1058,1060,He did not kill anyone in a wreck. He was sleeping. They should of respected him 4 that but no they tried to kidnap him taser him 4 resisting to go to jail. He told them what it was. Folk tired of cops pulling the trigger on them. Its a new form of lynching.  No reason to shoot him from running. They had his car. No reason to fear his life cause he ran off with the taser. Tell his wife and children how much you owe them atlanta. Nothing has changed in america.
1059,1061,Looks like murder
1060,1062,You got his car you got his face and probably driver‚Äôs license... why bother giving chase
1061,1063,"I thought CNN was better than this. There wasn‚Äôt a single mention of the fact the Brooks stole a taser from the cop and tried to use it on them. Why would anyone think that ‚Äúooh well since it wasn‚Äôt a deadly weapon the use of force wasn‚Äôt called for.‚Äù Like, really? If an office gets hit by a teaser, the same thing the would happen to any other citizen would have happened. The cop would have been paralyzed basically. So in that time he could have gone for the cops gun."
1062,1064,Let me guess another blue city.
1063,1065,"Sorry but you fought police and then ran, you don‚Äôt deserve to get away and do it again and possibly hurt someone next time"
1064,1066,CNN is complicit.
1065,1067,Don‚Äôt edit
1066,1068,Why burn Wendy's Restaurant?
1067,1069,"This is all fake they didn't actually show the full clip, the dude flipped the two cops over like WWE and steals their taser then points it at them! Take a look at the camera clip from the restaurant."
1068,1070,"Don't start no shit,
Won't be no shit..."
1069,1071,‚ÄúSome‚Äù of the victims aren‚Äôt helping them selves. Resisting ain‚Äôt gonna make the situation any better.
1070,1072,Running away with a less than lethal weapon does not require deadly force.
1071,1073,"Look guys, the use of lethal weapon is the only thing that would justify using lethal force. Taser isn't a lethal weapon. The dude was DRUNK, you guys are judging him on things he did while he was DRUNK.."
1072,1074,"I can see why a man with skin  not  white would be afraid of any cop all the time . What MUST be going through  Ray's  head is  ""I dont wanna die  so I'll run away"" I see a man afraid for his life .  and wow   what do ya know . he was right.   POLICE NEED TO BE TRAINED DIFFERENTLY  IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE."
1073,1075,CNNLOL
1074,1076,it is not about racism ..it is about police training.  The media making it worse.
1075,1077,He's trying to fire the taser at the police
1076,1078,The debate is was DEADLY force justifiable.
1077,1079,üòÇüòÇCNN censorship for the sheepleüòÇüòÇ
1078,1080,BIDEN 2020
1079,1081,STOP NORMALIZING BLACK DEATHS AND PAIN. start reporting the names of the cops more than the deceased. we should KNOW where to direct our energy and fury so these cops cant continue hunting humans
1080,1082,"They forgot to mention, CNN edited"
1081,1083,Maybe he resisted arrest because he was afraid the cops would kill him?
1082,1084,What is wrong with people now a day. What if the man had a heart attack? No one felt the need to come out and find out if he was ok. But instead they want to call the cop. Really? Are we serious? Was the cop needed? The wendy's manager didnt couldnt go out to find out what is wrong with the man. Or they are just affraid? I want to know.
1083,1085,They had his car and he is junk.
1084,1086,"I think worst case scenario, you shoot them in the legs, no need for kill shots. Another is that he was running away and they were not in danger. You have his car and info no need to kill for nonsense. If it was me i tell him to get  an uber and leave his car parked. Everybody lives"
1085,1087,CNN wouldn't know the truth if it sat on their nose and wiggled.
1086,1088,"Take his keys, and let him go. When he comes to get his keys, when he‚Äôs sober, he also receives his DUI citation."
1087,1089,"THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN SHOOT SOMEBODY RUNNING AWAY IN THE BACK FOR GRABBING A TAZIER IS INSANE.
THE COPS ARE BEHAVING LIKE SOLDIERS."
1088,1090,"Admit it, you came here for the comments."
1089,1091,Ok I‚Äôm definitely not racist. What I see here is a man trying to fight the police. If he would‚Äôve just been compliant none of this would‚Äôve ever happened.
1090,1092,CNN lies...he tased the officer & missed
1091,1093,"But I have to agree, the shooting was a bit much,, he was wanted for DUI ,not Murger or Rape."
1092,1094,"the use of deadly force was uncalled for
shooting a man in the back is a cowardly act"
1093,1095,This update was pointless as fuck..like come on...wtf
1094,1096,Still dont know why they were arresting him. A guy is sleeping in his car and he gets arrests.  Dont know what the hell is this . Comments from pakistaan.
1095,1097,as easy as this another black man's live is taken by police
1096,1098,"There is absolutely no debating this, that guy was bat shit crazy and attacked the cop , stole his taser I mean did everything wrong ...this is suicide by cop"
1097,1099,It's crazy how you try to justify someone running away and shooting them in the back. Cant even do that as a regular citizen why should the cop be free? This is why people doing whatever they want 2 do because the law enforcement dont know they law or follow it so why should they???
1098,1100,FTP
1099,1101,Getting shot in the back twice is just wrong.
1100,1102,The 1st bang you hear is the taser hitting the 1st cop. The partner doesn't see what it is. All he knows and sees is the guy fire and his partner get hit.
1101,1103,"Agree with the cop in interview here. It sucks Ray died he actually seemed genuinely nice and not a gangbanger or criminal. And of course this couldn't have happened in the worst days during all this BLM bull that the left is shoving down Americas throat. I understood it when it started and felt for black America but i lost complete respect for it when i saw how the left act and how they conduct themselves and the supports behind it and their background and what they are actually during yet supposedly fighting for.  Especially dislike how they  want to not admit all lives matter and you must not say or think it but must say Black lives matter? Its no longer a movement its now a threat and an agenda. Sorry truth hurts and they are losing their voice especially how all the antifa and hooligans are running around the street and rioting an looting. Now look at Wendy's state. What did God damn Wendys have to do with what happened? That's why I cant preach BLM. I just see it as a democratic supporter, Money laundering, antifa backing hate message that actually causes division more than the people say the president has done. This black cop on here had perfect sense and it just goes to show he does not see color but logic. Ray was a very nice guy and I would have acted differently if I were the cop and not run after him if he has my taser but they are trained to shoot if they are threatened and attacked and if they feel they can be subdued or killed. Now put yourself in Rays shoes. WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THE TASER IN THE FIRST PLACE? That would be the last thing running in my mind If i were desperate to go home and wanted to run away. And THAT'S the difference. Some people dont think and make it worse for themselves and you are taught/learned this since a kid when interacting with police. I know very well what I should NEVER do. And that's placing my hands on the police let alone his belt unless I wanted a worse charge or be shot. No matter how desperate or mad or if the cops were asshoels and had no right. They will only get backup and they will find you and you'll be in a worse rut for attacking and resisting etc. Folks you need to accept responsibility and be held accountable for your actions. These cops were more than nice and professional and they prolonged and beared the interaction with Ray more than I would have.  To make it worse now they want to seek the death penalty for the officer? Ridiculous. If the officers were picking on Ray and being racist and bullying him and shot and killed Ray planting the weapon in his hand to make it look like a struggle (like some cops have done actually) then I will agree the cop is corrupt and his death penalty is justified. THIS is CLEARLY not the case. People need to understand or cant comprehend the police training and what you learned and bring to your interactions and being on edge all the time with each stop and the heat of the moment when Ray fought and your on adrenaline and they shot you with a taser, your instincts and your adrenaline filled quick judgements can be impaired or misconstrued or training kicks in."
1102,1104,"Lets not mumble the facts here. The officers did not witness him driving and swerving and suspected intoxication. The guy was not driving under the influence of alcohol. He parked on private property and blocking a queue. He moved the vehicle based on the officer‚Äôs instruction. And they confronted him in a private property, presumably asleep, and they suspected he was drunk. "
1103,1105,He was found sleeping in his parked car not in motion.  He wasn't driving.
1104,1106,"Why do they have to shoot someone unarmed, and his crime was driving under the influence? He is on foot, he is clearly not dangerous."
1105,1107,Why does him being drunk and fleeing from the cops warrant his death?
1106,1108,This is why ppl hate CNN. Lol
1107,1109,CNN = CHAZ
1108,1110,"This was NOT a racist shooting or death.... The guy was intoxicated..... The guy resisted arrest...... The guy ran away and tried to turn around and use it on the police. In defense the police shot him in the altercation. It is hard to judge the police with what happened this night. Let the FBI review it under investigation, but this officer did his job. He did not deserve to lose his job."
1109,1111,Propaganda at its finest
1110,1112,This guy should not be dead
1111,1113,Garbage News Network
1112,1114,I am not from US  but I believe Yes black life do matter BUT sometimes people just too damn stupid to get killed. This one happen to be a black one. I feel really sorry for that cop that in trouble now.
1113,1115,I‚Äôm sorry but why is the media giving this so much coverage? George Floyd‚Äôs case was special in that it was so clearly wrong. This case on the other hand is not clear. He shouldn‚Äôt have run. He shouldn‚Äôt have pointed the taser. When cases like this get so much attention it starts to shed negative light on the larger movement.
1114,1116,"As a avid Puerto Rican for Trump, I don't agree with anything CNN says... Anything! However... I have to agree with CNN and how this guy broke the encounter down. I myself watched the whole 1 hour video for myself. These two cops were incredibly patient throughout the whole ordeal. After this all happen, the fired cop must be regretting his actions. "
1115,1117,look at the footage they decide to show no coincidence the wendys security camera footage has been available since like 6am this morning and they show this one
1116,1118,It's crazy how Americans bend over backwards to justify police violence. Y'all have issues üíï
1117,1119,"They didn't need to kill him just because he was drunk and intoxicated. He was shot dead because he was drunk and disorderly. They should have let him run, he wasn't a threat to anyone he wasn't armed and was running away. He would have been picked up the next day because it wouldn't have been difficult to identify him. Hell, when he was sober he would have probably handed himself. Just because he was intoxicated and resisted arrest it didn't give the police free licence to effectively execute him on the spot for what is a traffic violation effecting no one else. The Police should not have the right to execute someone for that."
1118,1120,Don‚Äôt ask for CNN to be shut down. It‚Äôs better the devil you know than the devil you don't. Atleast we know who they‚Äôre.
1119,1121,cnn is really trying hard to make it the officers fault lmao
1120,1122,CNN is doing a hell of job fanning the flame...
1121,1123,"Say hes name CNN


CANNON HINNANT"
1122,1124,What about him trying to tase the cop? Where is that part of the video cnn?
1123,1125,"It's sad to see those comments stating that ""he brought it upon himself"", he shouldn't have insulted the police"" if he only complied he would have been alive"", ""the homicide was justified"".The guy was D.R.U.N.K. I'm sure everyone here has been drunk before. And I'm sure that you know the actions drunk people portraye while being drunk do not reflect the actions of one that is sober. The decision he made while under the influence mind you should not dictate weather he should have lived or died."
1124,1126,"Do you want to show the clip where he shot the taser at the officer. If it got the officer, he could have gotten the gun, killed the officer, kill the other officer, and be a threat to everyone else in the drive through. This shooting WAS justified."
1125,1127,It has nothing to do with race man
1126,1128,Killed for sleeping?
1127,1129,Wendy's has the best 99-cent menu.  You can eat like a king for under 4 bucks.
1128,1130,"Tips for those who don‚Äôt want to get shot: DONT RUN...... STOP RESISTING... DONT STEAL A COPS TAZER, DONT POINT IT AT COP..... SIMPLE but NOOOOOOOOOOOO.........."
1129,1131,Shame on you officers. üò°
1130,1132,So lets all just ignore the video footage of Rayshard running off with the taser and pointing it a the police. That is why he got shot.
1131,1133,This was not an act of racism.
1132,1134,"Stupid incident, resulting in unnecessary pain and loss, guys, at the end of it all, people who are sober should have acted smartly. instead, they  made  the dumbest decision and shot a drunk man in his back"
1133,1135,"Eminent danger to your life, or the lives of others to justify using deadly force. Neither of these things was true for the officers or the general public. It was murder, plain and simple."
1134,1136,Soooo why did he resist tho ü§î ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è seriously all he had to do was go inü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò¢ smh I wish the officer would have just tased the man because this just not a good look for cops but seriously ppl why did the man resist and break wideüò≥ü§îü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíØ

1136,1138,I don't care
1137,1139,Why she has to say white cops and black guy?
1138,1140,"They just could have let him go, because they have hes information and car. So they could arrest him the next day."
1139,1141,Why don‚Äôt y‚Äôall play all of it. Also if he never resisted nothing would have happened.
1140,1142,Wendy‚Äôs lives matter
1141,1143,"Their ego and pride wouldn‚Äôt allow them to accept this black guy out wrestled them and got away, so they decided to shoot and kill rather than just accepting he got away momentarily and to just send an arrest warrant later at his address."
1142,1144,"the fact that some Americans think this is a justified shooting says it all. this doesn't happen anywhere else in the world. the standard of using this kind of force is so low in America. he has a taser and is running away so he should die? That's crazy. He pointed it at the police while running away.. are you kidding me? That is not a reason to shoot anybody. A taser is not a deadly weapon. it's not sold like one, it's not regulated as one and anybody can by one.. basically anywhere. You know his name, he's not a violent offender, you have his car keys so he cant drive and hurt anybody, he's running away and you know where he lives. there are 100+ tactics used all over the world that are smarter than shooting a drunk fool in the back for falling asleep drunk in his car. America - you've lived your whole life in this heightened reality of fear and violence.. a reality where people die when in contact with the police so you cant see how bizarre it is."
1143,1145,The national slogan for law enforcement should be changed from 'Protect & Serve' to 'Subdue & Kill'!
1144,1146,Why wasn't he at home taking care of his wife and kids? Why was the Wendy's burned down? People had jobs there and were trying to to pay rent and take care of their kids.
1145,1147,"He blocked the drive thru while drunk  driving then fought with da police and tried to take they taser? I ain't got time for diz foolishness. . 
Don't give that Fool a gold ‚ö∞Ô∏è and DO not clog up news wid dez sheet.. "
1146,1148,Is funny is not a man and officers is a black man and white officers xD
1147,1149,"God:  ‚Äúwhat?.., they shot you before you could get ya 4 for 4.. smh here‚Äôs a triple stack with bacon my guy.‚Äù"
1148,1150,"ANOTHER COP BEHAVING LIKE A SOLDIER IN A WAR.
INSANE."
1149,1151,"I mean, if the guy ran away. you still have his car's number details right? oh gunning him down makes lesser report? oh..."
1150,1152,Should have just taken the DUI instead of initiating a fight.
1151,1153,Why doesn't CNN show all races? It's not profitable.
1152,1154,"Goodness me.....some theories are really......*face palm*

Ok, so he managed to snatch an officer's taser and shot it at the officer. It's a bloody taser. Taser vs gun that shoots real bullets that can kill. In this case, did kill. And then there are others who say, but he's now got a taser. He can stun the officer and snatch his gun. Well, it's 2 v 1, isn't it? 2 officers vs one of him. While he tries to tase one officer, what's the other officer doing? Entertaining himself? Laughing at his partner being tased?"
1153,1155,"the use of deadly force was uncalled for
shooting a man in the back is a cowardly act"
1154,1156,Why the News don‚Äôt show him saying please let me walk home
1155,1157,Amazing they didn‚Äôt show him firing the taser at the cop .. Moral of the story don‚Äôt fight with the police and flee .. and you damn sure don‚Äôt fire any kind of weapon at them .. Stupidity has no color
1156,1158,Well the World is watching America is finished
1157,1159,Did they kill a guy because He was drunk? This is unbeliavable.
1158,1160,AGAIN????? Give me a break U.S.A!!!
1159,1161,Tabloid journalism/propaganda
1160,1162,THEY DELETING MY COMMENT WHICH BREAKS NO COMMUNITY GUIDELINES. READ MY REPLY üòÇ
1161,1163,"Gotta love that alcohol.  I'm thinking, as I watched it, ""what in gawd's name do you think you  are doing?!!!!!!""  He should not have been shot, they had his license, knew where he lived, they should have let him go. "
1162,1164,"I've seen all 5 videos released from very beginning to end, and theses are the facts (look it up people). He was drunk driving and already a hazard to other lives. He was IN the Drive thru lane passed out. The cops told him to move his car in a parking spot so he did. The cops were respectful to him did everything right gave him the test and he failed. How many innocent people die every year from DDs? Brooks at the same time was apparently cooperative and showed no signs of aggression. But at the time of the arrest OUT OF THE FU$%ing BLUE he starts getting violent. A struggle ensues, he overpowers 2 officers, assaults them steals a tazer and starts running from the scene of the crime. While running turns to shoot at the officer. Can you imagine getting tazed in your eyes? Cops know not to aim in suspects' faces but criminals don't. Brooks aimed that tazer at the cop's face. I'm going with the cop on this one. He had only seconds to react and shot him. The man may have been suicidal or even had committed a crime for evading arrest and if he escaped (while knowing the shitstorm he had put himself in = YEARS of prison) he could have simply gone on a rampage and start mass killings on innocent people who knows (extreme scenario). I'm glad the cops ended it there and no innocent lives were lost had he escaped.
 And if this was a white guy the same ending would have occured."
1163,1165,Well analyzed and the cops were definitely embarrassed. We need a conviction
1164,1166,He came to visit his Mother's grave & his daughter birthday was on Friday. You can see he is a gentleman. To my police u start very well with him. It's just the killing part that was not good because he has no weapon.
1165,1167,He ran? No he didnt. He tried to break free but was subdued immediately and fought to gain control. He was clearly a threat.
1166,1168,"I have watched the body cam, this in my opinion different to George Floyd case, the two police officers were very very patient, I have watched the 42 mins out o the 1 hour 23 minutes video, I mean 42 mins is long time, it went smooth but then I don't understand why the guy resisted and try to fight back the two cops. It's sad ending, I always thought this would end peacefully, apparently it ended up pretty badly."
1167,1169,There were 2 tasers.  Each cop had one.  the one that got fired in this cut version they show here is NOT the taser Brooks Stole before taking off.  You have to watch Wendy's Cam Video to see what happen after the fight.
1168,1170,He clearly states you have to be in fear of your life or the life of others in order to use deadly force & the taser is not a lethal weapon in the video!! You guys choose not to listen. Yes he shot a taser while running but he wasn‚Äôt even close enough to hit for one and for two that does not warrant him dying! You guys thing resisting arrest is an automatic death sentence.
1169,1171,"The cops just don't see to learn. I don't get it. What does it take to make them use their heads for something besides a hat rack? And then, instead of calling for an ambulance for the poor guy, they run around picking up shell casings? Should have fired BOTH of them just for that. That cop that did the shooting showed up looking to make a problem. He should be tried for murder."
1170,1172,This was a justified shooting.  The officer shouldn't have been fired
1171,1173,"Well she did warn us that they edited the video...
Conveniently....
But at least she was somewhat honest"
1172,1174,Man... george floyd was wrong but dude this .. i gotta side with cops u cant be doing that shit. Im a democrat through and through but we reaching on everything now
1173,1175,Although this is an example of what a suspect should never do because it's asking to be shot. What a cop has to remember is that if someone is running away from you and you shot them than you're killing in retaliation to them resisting you! The officer is not shooting the suspect in fear of his own survival!
1174,1176,"If I were the cop I would of bought that man some dinner there's a fast food joint right there, then chill until he sobers up and is safe to drive. Less paper work and helps the community."
1175,1177,You didn‚Äôt need to specify he was a black man. That name says it all lmao.
1176,1178,"We need to apply across all states similar ""rules of engagement"" as it is written under the Geneva Convention. I am confident that only 90% off the entire police force does not follow, abide, by their states law. There needs to be a rule that governs all in which officers are hold accountable the same way as in the military. That way that are disciplined at the highest level in which they will comply and obey. It's all about discipline, and these officers do not have any."
1177,1179,"I believe that in this in particular situation is not even remotely the same as the Floyd and countless other situations. I think it is important to make a distinction, that way unnecessary attention cannot lessen the justified gains for change that that Floyd tragedy has provided. There is plenty of issues of wrongful conduct and how The Police officers handled this particular case and their use of deadly force. But I cannot say it was racially motivated."
1178,1180,"He must have concluded that there would be more of a problem for him if he were taken in right then. Because running only adds additional charges and an arrest later, with additional punishment. That's alcohol."
1179,1181,"40 mins from start to end. He was drunk. He resisted. He ran away. If Wendy's had not called the Police, Rayshard would no doubt have crashed the car, possibly taking out  a family on the sidewalk or someone (one or more persons) in another car. Police were 100% innocent and Im not a fan of the Police but call it what it was."
1180,1182,MORAL OF THE STORY IS LISTEN TO THE POLICE AND HE'D BE ALIVE TODAY.
1181,1183,"That was beyond unnecessary, even if he had grabbed the stun gun he fired it rendering it useless, and they had the car, which made finding him easy. There was no reason to even consider him a threat that was basically see a man go down unload your weapon."
1182,1184,"A perfect example of what not to do when interacting with the Police. The shoot was justified, Police have the right to protect themselves."
1183,1185,"So my question is, if the guy was running away and leaving his car behind.... couldnt they let the guy go and confiscate the car where it has all his information and then look for him later?  

Like, cops somehow seem to believe you shoot first and ask questions later, this needs to change.  Every other country in the world has more experienced and professional cops, why cant US train and background check their cops before they hire them and give them a gun?"
1184,1186,"Driving drunk is not acceptable üòÇ, not compling and being combative with the officers, taking the taser is unacceptable. Officer reacted with shooting Rayshard Brooks, I feel is wrong. No one wins, so very sad."
1185,1187,"Sorry, BUT this time this guy was on the wrong. Resisting and fighting, AND stealing officer taser. common body you should know how that gonna end for you."

1192,1194,Looks pretty fair to me.
1193,1195,It's simple people!!!! COMPLY AND YOU WONT DIE!!!!!!!
1194,1196,The cops panicked and opened fire when they seen that he took the taser... they should‚Äôve just called in backup and pursue the guy.
1195,1197,Don‚Äôt break the law!
1196,1198,"As an outside observer, I'm amazed at the number of Americans who think it is okay to kill a person on the spot for doing what this guy did. Sure, he shot a taser at the police but that shouldn't be a reason to shoot him. He should have been tried and punished accordingly. I don't know of any other first world countries where so many people would see this as acceptable."
1197,1199,"I don't think this case this is racial. I watched the long version. The cops still fucked up though, they didn't need to kill the guy. He resisted arrest, he didn't threaten their lives. He shouldn't be dead! Very sad."
1198,1200,I think the police should just stop responding to calls for about a month. Just shut down 911 system all together.  This should put things into better perspective.  Let the animals have their way.
1199,1201,The last time I checked when you get in a fight you take the chance of killing someone so in my book that would be self-defense after attempting to murder a cop by punching him in the face then he turned and try to shoot another cop with a Weapon
1200,1202,Sleeping in the car is now a death sentence.
1201,1203,Well the shooters partner dham sure didn't appreciate his wreckless partner shooting. . The cop that gave the sobriety test. He said. Resisting is just part of the job. Its not a Haleys comet that happens every 90yrs. Its frequently. No need to shoot to kill over it.
1202,1204,The cop was just PO that he lost the taser. Shure didn't want to have to admit he lost it to a young black man who wasn't able to be controlled by two white officers. What kind of training did these officers have?
1203,1205,Stop resisting
1204,1206,"44' min. of tape , and all it shows is D.W.I. suspect standing on one foot while the other foot is raised in front . Then state he failed the field sobriety breath test? Then  an attempt to handcuff suspect. Then the camera is conveniently displayed shooting into  the night sky. O.K. Even if guilty as charged . D.W.I. , Failing to comply with a lawful order , resisting arrest with violence  , eluding arrest. It does not warrant being stalked  , and shot .  He was asleep @ the wheel of his car in a drive thru attempting to get a meal. When he was abruptly awakened. Pulls over and parks as directed , and  44' min. later he is laying dead? This is just an example of the Marxist lead BLM, and the Clinton/Soros driven Antifa group is going to do to Our Nation. It is the human race that has a target on their back. The Covid19, and George Floyd event are false flags. They are playing us , and too  many are being fooled. They want to further devastate the already plunged petro dollar , and the Wall Street Casino derivatives by destroying small businesses, and allow the rioters to burn the same business buildings ? They are having us turn on ourselves.  Their momentum  for the ""New Normal"" is on steroids.  The Police Chief was probably the true target. She exemplified by example how an officer should handle true protesters. Another false flag? Do we have footage of the deceased? NO!"
1205,1207,He'd be alive today if he just complied. So sad.
1206,1208,Both rayshard and the officer that shot him are both in the wrong
1207,1209,"News cant just say, the guys name etc- why say, The black man??"
1208,1210,I mean forsure don‚Äôt drink and drive then decided to run and then decided to shoot A taser at the cops.
1209,1211,"Why shoot him, he didn‚Äôt harm them. He ran and they killed him. WTF. I mean this is what you are trained to do. Just shoot the guy. Jesus let me stay in my corner."
1210,1212,It‚Äôs not fair cops should of gave him another chance to grab their guns this time  with a wrestling match
1211,1213,"he tooked the taser from cop, and used it to the cop. how do you know he will not take the gun from the cop and used against the cop ?"

1215,1217,This guy could have used the taser to take one of the policemen‚Äôs guns and kill them or other people. Once he turned around to point the taser at the officers (which is conveniently not shown in this footage) the police had to use deadly force.
1216,1218,Street parks Scared to fight so they pick up a  Gun cowards
1217,1219,The police did the right thing why did he try to fight them and run come on they got u all ready and then they ask. Why people are scare of black people he didn't look like a thug but they way he active was like that come on
1218,1220,Cop should sue for wrongful termination. If that guy hits the cop with the taser then he will have access to a lethal weapon also this was split second reaction to a situation where a suspect points a weapon back at the officer and fires. Easy to Monday morning quarterback sitting at home behind a screen.
1219,1221,i dont care what he was doing no guns the man would be alive end of story. cops should not have summary judgement powers deadly force is not justified when a man takes a tazer non lethal fires or not the cop was in no danger at all from a fleeing drunk man in which they had his information and could arrest him alive in an hour.
1220,1222,If you would have shown the whole video you would have seen the guy turn around a shoot the razer at the officer. But of course that doesn't matter.
1221,1223,Know what the difference between his blood alcohol level and the legal limit? About one beer.

1233,1235,"I‚Äôm so sick and tired of you guys justifying killing a man over a taser gun is okay. Need to remember there was another cop helping. And you guys saying he could have paralyzed the cop, you could say the same for him. The situation was bad yes, he should not have fought the cops. But the man was under the influence, you really think he could think that far ahead and try and ‚Äútake the cops gun‚Äù really?!?! The man was running away for crying out loud! And don‚Äôt try and make yourself sound like a saint and pretend like you‚Äôve never drove under the influence, because we all know your a damn liar, like your dumb ass president."

1236,1238,why fatally shot an unarmed drunk  driver?
1237,1239,I think the officer took his camera out on purpose
1238,1240,What‚Äôs happening in USA?

1242,1244,"so you're saying to use deadly force against someone who ISN'T using deadly force? Thats like someone swinging a foam bat at me and so I use my METAL bat at them.

There is a difference to should being jailed and being dead. "

What lunacy is this??!! If only Brook's would have actually gotten the officer's gun and not the taser then possibly people would be saying things differently. Probably. But, Brooks probably didn't know he had grabbed the taser, and maybe thought he had the gun and shot at the officers. How the heck is the officer gonna react in a situation like this??  "

1268,1270,WTF? I love the framing they went with in this video. He didn't have a weapon when they search him therefore he never had one... except when he grab the taser from the cop. CNN did an 'oopsie' and left that part out.
1269,1271,"Leave it to CNN to hide the truth.... There is another camera angle that shows, as he was running away he had the officers taser and he turned and shot it at the officers. From the moment he started to turn and point it at the officers,  It took the officers less than 2 seconds to shoot him. Completely justified. If the taser prong hit an officer in the eye it would be fatal. The officers saw this and had a second to respond. Good on them."
1270,1272,"He should've not resisted and ran,  They kilt him for it."
1271,1273,You can‚Äôt handle the truth ..: the fbi you know the world sees what I see when I‚Äôm typing
1272,1274,it is all too crazy. I just hope now that this does not turn out to be more protesting. C19  is growing crazy. And ow with this again. To crazy
1273,1275,"its sad that hes dead, but why did he run?"
1274,1276,Postictal epileptic state.
1275,1277,"he was drunk resisting arrest  and he stole a taser from the cop ran and taser on cop ,Dam dude what you think they going to do...."
1276,1278,"Sad...all the way around...sad that people drink and drive...so many people killed by those actions, so of course he should have been arrested...BUT once they knew he didn‚Äôt have a weapon on him and after he struggled with them and he got away...why not just let him go...why shoot??? They had his car there with his information..they could have dealt with him at a later date because they had the video footage and the breath test....killing him was absolutely just murder...and it‚Äôs also sad that a business was burned that had nothing to do with the death...that was the policeman that fired the gun. If Wendys called the police, they had a right to...it wasn‚Äôt their fault that the cop did what he did.....what is wrong with our country??? Killing someone/treating someone as less because they have a different skin color is so wrong....can‚Äôt believe people still let this happen...Read some history people and learn from it!!!!"
1277,1279,"They should not arrest him. They suppose to give him a ticket. He told the police he can walk back home he will leave the car @ the parking lot. 
Why the police didn't drop him home or walk him home?
Where is the compassion police? No heart @ all."
1278,1280,Enough is Enough like damn it‚Äôs starting to become a tradition
1279,1281,Why not just tranq dart and throw a net over it? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1280,1282,The guy was asleep in a car.  He failed a sobriety test.  Did he need to be handcuffed and arrested.  Couldn't they just drive him home? Or ask him to call a ride to pick him up?  If they had just responded in kindness and make sure the man didn't drive and made sure he got home safely then NONE of this would have happened.
1281,1283,"Taser in United States is not considered a deadly weapon and also the guy was running away and he didn‚Äôt even really aimed at the police, just shot the taser behind him and kept running.The cop can‚Äôt even say he fear for his life because he chased after the guy and gunned him down. First Degree Murder. Premeditated. if anything, they should just let him go, they had his information his license plate, his face and his name and they could‚Äôve just picked him up later and took him to jail. I‚Äôm a lawyer here in Georgia."
1282,1284,A taser vs a gun. Why would the person with the gun be that scared?
1283,1285,"He was stopped, he was sleeping, He didn't want to drive Drunk. The cops could offered him a ride home, They could of asked for a friend's number or wife's number to come get him. ( impounding his car or leaving it parked over night in the lot ) Could of asked him if he could call an Uber. There is so many things they could of done that wasn't Arrest him for sleeping drunk in a parking lot. For anyone saying he turned and fired a tazer at the so was justified... no. It should of ever gotten this far. This is what Defund the police means, this is what putting money into training for De-escalation means."
1284,1286,He was asleep under influence.
1285,1287,"Don't resist arrest.
Why are we wasting time on these lawless thugs."
1286,1288,Sucks he got smoked but reaching around the officers belt EVERYONE'S lucky he didn't take the officers gun and start blastin fools. Or carjack someone tryna flee.
1287,1289,Why would they call police for a sleeping person just go wake them up!
1288,1290,What Rayshard did was undeniably stupid.  For a black man to become combative with police in this day and age is all too often a death sentence.  Rayshard did not deserve to have his life ended for his poor decision making.  The officer made an even worse decision. He shot an unarmed man who was running away.  Another tragedy on all sides.  America is losing.
1289,1291,But you would still support the uses of tasers... like many *Americans...not supporting the struggle
1290,1292,"This was justified,  you dont fight with police like that and run away with their tasers."
1291,1293,So dui is now legal ?
1292,1294,"They could‚Äôve simply given the dude a ride home, you see he didn‚Äôt want any problems to began with"
1293,1295,So was the guy actually drunk
1294,1296,"It just makes no sense. No weapon, no threat.  Yes he ran, but you have his car and id.  Catch him later."
1295,1297,What s wrong with YOU ALL? He started fighting them! he tried to hurt them! They did what they needed to do!
1296,1298,"Have respect for the authorities, people!!!  'So simple ..."
1297,1299,What is going on in America...
1298,1300,and always in Democrat cities! what a surprise
1299,1301,"U are finding out how it feels Wendy's across the world , don't. Burn them down just don't eat there,!"
1300,1302,it'n not about racism.. i will be treated the same if i did what that guy did
1301,1303,"- DUI
- Resisting arrest
- Assault on police officers
- Stealing an officer's weapon"
1302,1304,Play the whole video cnn......just saying....
1303,1305,No one who runs should be shot!!!! Only if ones life is in eminent danger. Period. All the rest is murder. Hold all accountable with jail time and never be allowed to carry a permit for a weapon.  Same as us citizens. They are not above the law but many believe that they are. And many times the law does back them up....so this means that the department's themselves are corrupt! So we don't trust them
1304,1306,"Can you be armed with a taser? If so, he was not ""unarmed"".  Too bad he turned around to shoot because looks like he might have gotten away if he'd just kept running."
1305,1307,Can't only hold the officer accountable for his actions
1306,1308,Tragedy....
1307,1309,How was this disturbing... This video is of a camera shaking 99% of the time. We didn't see shit. Smdh
1308,1310,"Driving Drunk Kills.. Let's not make this guy a saint. He shouldn't have payed with his life. Do as the Cops say and get a Lawyer asap, don't run.."
1309,1311,The guy grabbed the taser and shot it at the police....why did they not show that? Anyone!?the officers tried to use Nonlethal force and the dude took that option away.
1310,1312,100% justified. Proud of police. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëÆ‚ù§Ô∏èüëÆüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
1311,1313,"I am just disgusted to see the insensitive, inhumane comments implying this man deserved a shot. Wtf is wrong with you people."
1312,1314,Go check out donut operator
1313,1315,"How does that police officer, and the police force, justify killing a person by shooting them in the back as they are running away from a suspected DUI, having previously confirmed that the individual was unarmed with a deadly weapon? The reckless disregard for Rayshard‚Äôs life demonstrated by the police officer‚Äôs decision to fire his weapon into the back of Rayshard as he fled, indicated the degree to which Rayshard‚Äôs life mattered to that police officer.  Rayshard‚Äôs life did not matter to that police office. The unwarranted deadly force used by the police officer who shot and killed Rayshard as he attempted to run away, amounts to murder."
1314,1316,"He took a Taser from the Police Officer, ok we get that!  but why shooting him down with a GUN leading to his death ????"
1315,1317,I'm convinced that CNN wants to watch America burn... Just not their houses.
1316,1318,Murder first degree
1317,1319,"Honestly they did everything people have been saying police should do. The only wrong thing they did was shoot the guy, they should‚Äôve let him get away but we don‚Äôt know what was going through the guys mind he just watched his partner get assaulted and tased."
1318,1320,"Oh,what the f*k news"
1319,1321,SEIJI HEITO
1320,1322,Officers had every right to do what they did. What would you do if suspect is resisting arrest. Punches you in the face than tries to taser you?
1321,1323,"Knowing the racist history of the Atlanta PD, what would a black man think would happen by fighting arrest after blowing red, stealing the taser (so now you're ""armed w/a deadly weapon"") then fleeing the scene? True apprehension could've happened later & 3 shots in the back is criminal but it's ATL PD?! He died for being stupid. This is NOT a Floyd situation."
1322,1324,Democrat city.
1323,1325,"Again....why shoot him...why are police triggered to shoot first.
Ok chase him...call for more backup...he was drunk he could not have gotten far.
Why shoot ...he did not have a gun and aiming a taster at an officer would never have landed on a target...he was drunk."
1324,1326,It's not real.
1325,1327,Don't resist arrests and fight with police.
1326,1328,"All the officer had to do was not shoot him. This guy would have been charged for assaulting a police officer, they had his car in the parking lot, his license plate is all they need to find his address. You think a drunk man is a menace to society? The cop put himself in that situation now he must face the consequences."
1327,1329,A taser is not a gun wit bullets there was 2 cops on 1 man and they got mad cause he was going to get away simple so they shot him in the back after he turned away to run from them after he pointed a taser towards them like he cop said it didnt pierce the skin so further more the cop didn't even feel the taser so shooting him in the back is not justifiable I saw he entire video can't help those cops r weaker than a 2 yr old child and couldnt apprehend 1 damn man
1328,1330,"So this is the way CNN recommends people respond when getting in contact with the police?  Resist arrest,  grab their taser, run, turn around and use that taser."
1329,1331,üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠when will this stop!!! When we are all dead? Is that what they want?!!!
1330,1332,"They have to come up with a new law, for drinking give the person a ticket, call the person family to come get the person."
1331,1333,"America teaching the world about democracy, freedom and equality is like a 3-year old kid teaching people how to run a corporation."
1332,1334,"He had nothing on him and yeah he grabbed a taser but it's just a traser. They should have just pursued, arrested, and charged him for DUI and resisting arrest. There was no reason for the policeman to shoot him as none of them had any threat to their lives. To me, this is a clear overuse of force and now a man's life is lost."
1333,1335,"Hey CNN. Video edited to your liking?
What you are doing is pouring fuel onto the fire."
1334,1336,He stole the taser and pointed it at officers. It‚Äôs what the girl gets.
1335,1337,Shit it‚Äôs not Trump fault ???
1336,1338,"Tase the cop and steal his gun like you did the taser.  Mr Brooks just fought off 2 officers and forcefully took the taser.  Mr Brooks was clearly a threat, cops have died by letting a suspect take their gun"
1337,1339,"Why did they approach this man at a drive thru fast food spot (I'm guessing, but a drive thru none the less) anyway? With 3-4 squad cars?"
1338,1340,Commentator makes a good point ü§î
1339,1341,"He shouldn't be killed for it, period. But why did he drink and drive then resist arrest? After all that he punched the police and shoot the taser gun at police. If he just told the police he is drunk and let them arrest him none of these would happen."
1340,1342,"If the choice is letting a non-deadly crime offender go and kill him, is killing really the right choice?"
1341,1343,That guy had it coming the second he resisted. Image if you're a small person trying to arrest him. He could overpower you and kill you.
1342,1344,"This man was sleep-- in his car-- in a drive through.... Probably tired, maybe working 2-3 jobs... had a drink and fell  asleep,, why not just explain that your taking him in just to sober up for his safety... Because technically,,, the car was not in motion...it was stopped.. .  Maybe that would/could  have changed the out come of everything.."
1343,1345,This does not happen to white guys.
1344,1346,Another man had died because of his stupidity.
1345,1347,"So a guy beats two cops steals their taser runs away trying to taser the cops and the cop gets sacked and the Police Chief is forced to resign, madness"
1346,1348,As a black man i hate to say this but this is a justifiable murder in the eyes of the law. And the police will not be prosecuted for this. I'm sad that the brother lost his life and I understand how police treat us as black people because I have experience such treatment from a police officer. But they are the law and when given a command we are supposed to follow their command. And the brother took that taser and aimed it at them which made it lawfully for them to fire at him. Now morally I don't think they should have shot the brother but by law they can do it and get away with it because of that badge that they wear on their shoulder.
1347,1349,They could just handled the situation way differently
1348,1350,Why not a low velocity rubber bullet not a big problem yet??????????????had a cop with a nut and a knife he's dead and the cop missed the leg!. Also gose with the tazzer had a guy off his face he got the tazzer on top it looks like he was a % on heart condition he's also dead these are last resort not a toy! üòëüòïüò°üò¨üò†5 not happy Jane!
1349,1351,COPS....Filmed on location with the murderous cowards of American law enforcement.
1350,1352,"I'm not going to call bullshit, but the narration is a little misleading. Brooke's didn't do anything to deserve being killed over but he sure did his best to make it happen. Whether your black, white, Asian or lati√±o don't get violent with the poli√ße."
1351,1353,Yes he was searched before he faught the cops and in the scuffle is it possible that he could have managed to get more than just the tazer? Or do you assume that he only got the tazer off you and your partner whom he beat in a fight?
1352,1354,"So let me get this straight. The young man knew he was intoxicated and instead of driving home, he parked at Wendy's so that he wouldn't drive intoxicated,  feared for his life because the cops were picking on him, broke free, steals a taser, runs away from the cops and was shot dead. In what world is that justified?"
1353,1355,100% Justified. Just sayin.
1354,1356,Well it's a shame but he asked for that one.
1355,1357,Shouldn‚Äôt attack cops. Suppose they could of shot him in the leg.
1356,1358,"He wasn't in the act of driving and he wasn't in the act of drinking, so what was he being arrested for?"
1357,1359,This could of been avoided if the dui laws wernt so stupid
1358,1360,Im beginning to hate CNN. You have to watch the entire video. The officer was polite from the start. Rayshard should not have taken his taser and then pointed back at the officer while running and even shot it at him. Im sure all the officer saw was himself being shot at. Rayshard was 100% wrong in this situation and got himself killed.
1359,1361,"Give a weak guy a weapon and this happens. Notice his ID, take his driver licence and send him home. Done."
1360,1362,"I‚Äôm on the side of the victim overall, but from what I‚Äôm seeing both in these videos and others is that everything was fine until they tried to put the handcuffs on him, then he resisted, grabbed the cop‚Äôs taser pistol, took it, ran, pointed it back at the officer that was chasing him with the intention to tase him, and then he was shot with a firearm.  "
1361,1363,You should always comply with the police
1362,1364,"I dont know if this is actually on the cops.  You cant allow someone to struggle or flee when arresting them, even if you must shoot them, regardless of the offense.  Someone could have shoplifted a loaf of bread, but he tries to take your sidearm or run away there's no choice."
1363,1365,"It‚Äôs just another day at the office for these guys, smh so sad. Shoot an impaired man in the back because he pointed a taser off to the side low to the ground. The man would have clearly missed & you fire 3 rounds at damn near point blank range. He is a human being!!! Did everyone else see the cops face while he was questioning him...?? He better get prosecuted."
1364,1366,"It was a very dangerous situation when they were fighting but when the fighting was over and he was running should not have shot him, unless there's something we're not seeing. This is very sad outcome. come"
1365,1367,"this one's contentious but I think we can all agree that he didn't have to lose his life given that he was initially co-operating and interacting with the officer in a friendly manner

if you have to shoot, why not shoot in the leg or another area where death by gunshot wound is unlikely?"
1366,1368,I'm not a cop my strengths lie with planetary science and biology. I do know off the top of my head at least three different ways to deescalate the situation. So confused how was the cops life in danger due to the very same taser they use on ppl?
1367,1369,"I could have understood if the officer shot once in the legs to disable the guy and subsequently detain him. BUT HE SHOT HIM 3 FREAKING TIMES!! 3 TIMES!!

YOU DON'T SHOOT SOMEONE 3 TIMES UNLESS YOU INTEND TO KILL! THESE OFFICERS ARE TERRIBLY TRAINED"
1368,1370,"was watching CNN covering this on TV earlier, they tried to imply the one cop intentionally discarded his body cam during the struggle and completely ignore that the dead guy shot the taser he took from the cops at the cops, thank God the lead up to and the attempted arrest for DUI was by the book.  Come to find out the deceased was a repeat guest at the grey bar hotel."
1369,1371,When you do what he did you put your life endanger.  I do think cops need to know when not to use deadly force and when they know he has no gun a kill shot isn‚Äôt called for.  That was a horrible result   I‚Äôm sure cops In extreme conditions like that panic like any other human but man that‚Äôs just bad a man is dead and 2 cops just threw away there carries and the 1 should do some jail time
1370,1372,"This dude has a death wish!  Suicide by cop, or he was really scare of going home to his gf.  But, the cops acted professionally is a law enforcement capacity.  How can anyone argue this? How can anyone said the cops were at fault?"
1371,1373,"‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èpolice . Thank you for protecting our rights ,property and well being"
1372,1374,"What's so hard about accepting that you messed up and accepting it like a man? You're being arrested for a DUI, then you go and assault 2 cops, take a weapon, try and use it against them and flee. You are asking for trouble"
1373,1375,"Here is my take. Let the man runaway. They knew who he was, they had his vehicle, and knew he would be going home eventually. Central silly and stupid fight with somebody when you can simply just go pick them up the next fucking day."
1374,1376,"A taser, if used for too long, can in fact be deadly or at least cause sever brain damage, to the point of putting someone in a vegetative state. Once tased, the officer would then have zero control over the situation. What a sad situation from all perspectives."
1375,1377,"Unfortunately two lives have been ruined by one quick decisions in  the heat of the night.

1st. Was to resist arrest and beat down two cops, who were just doing their job dealing with a nothing situation."
1376,1378,A MAN that's drunk driving gets questioned for 45 minutes by two very respectful officers. The man fails a field sobriety test. The man then resists arrest and commits 5 to 10 different felony assaults on officers. It's abundantly clear to all that have watched the full video that the man is clearly winning the brawl versus the two officers. The man then wrestles a weapon away from one of the officers. The man then fires that weapon at the officers and gets shot. The man got EXACTLY what he deserved. His skin color is meaningless.
1377,1379,"I have to keep it real he should have just gone into custody, with DUI he would have been out the next day. This is not all on the officers this time. Didn't have to shot him but if the taser incapacitated the cop everything on his belt including his firearm could be taken. Bad situation for all involved but this isn't like what happened to Floyd."
1378,1380,This is what I dont get why are we so ok with cops being judge jury an executioner I get it he stole a tazer an tried to run off why no de escalate an let him u already have his car and information ur well in the right to issue a warrant
1379,1381,"The suspect held all the power in regards to what happened during the investigation.   At any time he could have submitted.  Too many suspects believe they can stop an arrest, they cannot.  Submit to the arrest and fight the charges later..if you don't think you should be arrested DO NOT FIGHT, TALK TO OR RUN FROM THE OFFICER IT IS NOT THE TIME!!!!!"
1380,1382,"He doesn't have a weapon until he fights and takes a weapon in which then he has a weapon. He didn't mention that. He also didn't mention that he gained the DUI test. Bottom line, don't be a crook."
1381,1383,Perfect example of suicide by cop.
1382,1384,"Criminals don't follow Police instructions and run.
What's the point of having Laws if these people don't follow them.
Salute to Police for dealing with these oddities."
1383,1385,"Years ago we had a young mentally ill caucasian man drugged up who ran at police with a huge knife, they shot him dead.
From that day on i told my 3 children growing up if you ever point anything at police then expect to be shot."
1384,1386,"Whole Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5imM40d5Fs&feature=youtu.be

There is a difference between the deaths of George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks."
1385,1387,I‚Äôve seen the entire body cam video. He was drunk and not thinking clearly at all. 2 cops got man handled by 1 man and he takes off with a stun gun (non lethal weapon) and shoots it back towards the officers. At this point they know he can‚Äôt reload it and he is also drunk running. Tell me why as a police officer you decide to shoot this man like he‚Äôs a fleeing fugitive wanted for murder. This was a DUI stop with resisting arrest charge and sleep it off in the drunk tank. It‚Äôs now murder by another dumb ass scared cop with lack of training and common sense.
1386,1388,"Drunken ... is.. . Dead..  in us. 
Be careful, never drink üç∏alcohol.."
1387,1389,"Rayshard Brooks DID THE RIGHT THING! He may have been too drunk to drive. He didn‚Äôt continue driving. He pulled off the road to sleep it off, which eliminated any chance of him becoming a hazard to anyone or anything. 
His family should lawyer up and seek whatever compensation can be had in order to get the point across that CHANGE needs to happen."
1388,1390,Pure anarchy.  ü§£üòÇü§£
1389,1391,"Why the police department teach them to shoot to kill , ?? 
What about shotting someone in the leg , when they running from you , even in  wild west times  shotting someone on the back was dishonest.... I miss the old cops shows where police would tackle anyone running and bit the shit out of them ..."
1390,1392,A taser for A life where was the cops taser?that guy knew they had guns and they used it to kill him
1391,1393,Really CNN! It is criminal the way you edited this video. You made it appear like he was asleep in the drive-through and they woke him up and he immediately drove his car to a parking place. You did not show how many times the officer had to go back and wake him up before he even moved his car. You didn‚Äôt show him punch the officer in the face. You didn‚Äôt show him try to shoot the officer in the face with the taser. You didn‚Äôt show the people in the parking lot that he was running toward with a weapon he stole from a cop. What are you trying to do - start more riots! CNN I supported you through all these years only to find out Trump was right. You are Fake News!
1392,1394,"This is exactly why we need change, this shit can't keep happening"
1393,1395,"If you want the full video here's the link:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhdpG2XzRXQ"
1394,1396,Keep them coming cnn. Would be good if you could show a few more that have happened in the past. Really show the injustice.
1395,1397,"Why does it always have to be 'shoot to kill'? In decent countries, cops are trained to use minimal force. Fire a warning shot first, and if that does not have any effect, shoot to disable the suspect (ie: aim for the legs, or the arm holding a weapon). The use of lethal force should be avoided at all times. Killing a suspect is a failure on the cop's part. My guess is that most US cops are insecure and scared, hence all the use of deadly force. I've seen a video of a cop shooting a suspect 18 times, at close range!! Cops should NEVER panic like that."
1396,1398,"Not up to me to determine, but if he takes the cop's taser, and tries shooting them with it, the cops are in danger of being incapacitated (what the taser is for) and then their deadly weapons could be taken, so from the cop's point of view, it's the same as if he took their gun.  (and for all practical purposes its the same, because after he successfully tases a cop, NOTHING stops him from taking their firearms.  And since he has already shown intent to use force against them, it's reasonable to assume he would continue to do so if given the chance.   It still sucks that they chose to shoot him, and could not deal with it in another way that did not result in his death, but this will be hard to prove that it was not justified, because it's relatively easy to prove that it was.   Sad all around, and condolences to the family. There has to be a better way.  how about throwing him the cuffs and asking him to put them on?   not sure, but somebody figure something out, so this does not keep happening."
1397,1399,Police are judge and jury
1398,1400,Nothing would of happen if he would just comply with officers
1399,1401,yall can look up the whole video on youtube. ‚Äúat this point they don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs drinking‚Äù. cnn dont know what they are talking about. you can hear through the cop breath what he was thinking in the full video. cop: ‚Äúhe‚Äôs so wasted‚Äù ‚Äúdo i really need to deal with this guy‚Äù
1400,1402,The autopsy report came out the man was shot in the back I guess those police officers were in real Danger for their lives from the man's backside that's a new one
1401,1403,"Granted the guy resisted the officers, but who can blame him?
The late George Floyd, God rest his soul, was cooperating with the cops, 
and what did he get after detainment? Unjustifiable tragic death. 
There is a trust-issue between citizens under minority race, "
1402,1404,This the problem. People just jump on a clip. Instead of waiting for the whole videos. Also what about the witness claim they never issued a test? The guy was drugged up.
1403,1405,"They said the taser was already discharged by the police and not reloaded before the suspect stole it. So the suspect stole and pointed a yellow piece of plastic at the officers. That's unarmed, and not endangering the officer's life in any way."
1404,1406,The thing is didn't have to kill him I think he was just complying initially but he should have never fought back. He put the cops in a difficult position. But the cops could have also taken his keys and drove him. Then issue a summons so you can appear in court.
1405,1407,Everyone needs to understand of the video and the spoken of a communication it is but sometime that nobody knows have the right answer but this is only a matter of time. What's going to happen next
1406,1408,‚úåÔ∏èüòé
1407,1409,Look closely at the video the officer in lead had his tazer in his hand dropped it at the red car and used car as a platform to shoot the guy in the back ...just look tazer are bright ass yellow can't miss him dropping it to pull his service weapon
1408,1410,"He shot the officer with the taser. He was clearly a threat. 
First of all, he shouldn‚Äôt have fled from the police. Then the police would‚Äôve never shot him. This is not about black or yellow or white. He was a suspect, who was trying to run from the police, and police was just doing their job. If they can‚Äôt do anything to the suspect who is being a threat to them, how can police protect themselves and protect the people???"
1409,1411,"In Canada hear they usually first will block his car so he/she can‚Äôt drive off, then they will ask questions while you are in the car. At no time do they allow you to get out of the car until more officers arrive. At that point they might put handcuffs on you for the safety of both parties. It was wrong of them asking him to get out of his car before asking him questions"
1410,1412,"If I took a taser or gun off an officer, I would expect them to possibly shoot me."
1411,1413,"We don't give a damn who you want to vote for, start making news!"
1412,1414,"And now can we talk about what a coward the police chief was for firing the officers, quitting his job and running for the hills over this?"
1413,1415,"The suspect WAS ARMED...armed with the cop‚Äôs taser. Being shot by a taser can incapacitate the cop to the point that he would not have any control over his duty belt which is loaded with other weapons that could be used against him. The driver DID fire the taser at the officer. The officer returned fire. So, is the cop supposed to let the driver shoot him with the taser? What is the threshold?"
1414,1416,"This is what a police state looks like! 
He made a mistake and wasn't in his right mind. He stated he was an emotional situation with visiting his mother's grave, he's been drinking, maybe he was scared because he knows what happens quite often as a black person in police custody."
1415,1417,"Please people vote! All these protests wont have meant a thing if you dont vote. Not just for president, but for your local elections as well. The reason the pay gap keeps growing is politicians only care about elderly because they vote. Young people have to vote or nothing will change."
1416,1418,"Here's the deal, I don't believe this was a racially motivated incident, the cops were normal and easy, the man was easy and cooperating:pat down, sobriety test, etc. Dude just wasn't having getting arrested and was intoxicated. Officer got his tail punked, tased at by his own taser and was ticked and decided to act foolish. He used unnecessary force and acted as a bad/unprofessional cop, and as such deserved to be fired and possibly charged. The poor man should not be dead today."
1417,1419,"just for more clarity, there's another that has the perspective of the dashcam. It's much clearer. Though I think it's pretty obvious from this video that Brooks was resisting."
1418,1420,Who did the 2nd cop take right before the shots?
1419,1421,why did the body cam get ditched?
1420,1422,"Let's see, everything was going just fine up until the point he decided to resist the arrest and fight with the cops, the cops even started out with non lethal approach to get him under control and cuffed, he over powered the cops they were trying to use there taser's but unfortunately the perp took the cops means of non lethal force, had the intoxicated perp actually shot the cop with it and subdued him he could have had alot of possibilities to disarm the cop of his firearm, and mind you he is under the influence of alcohol, and his mind is obviously not thinking right because he has already resisted the arrest and started the fight with the cops, you have know idea what he is capable of doing, especially being intoxicated.."
1421,1423,It‚Äôs sad you could rationalize  killing a man whose running  away all because he gave u a punch or 2. üôÅ or system is disappointing. üò§ lets defund them and create our own private police force!
1422,1424,Taser is supposed to be a non deadly weapon SOOOOOOO why do y‚Äôall care to see that part of the vid? Stealing taser & shooting taser is not grounds for death
1423,1425,Police provoked the incident.
1424,1426,"Why people say oh why didnt they call him a uber, u are caught DUI freaking don't resist arrest, and grap a cops taser,  so why resist..it would a DUI and then he would be alive. He didnt want to get caught maybe he had previous DUI, maybe had suspended license. It was a dumb move by someone trying to give all sorts of excuses on why he fell asleep, I bet if he was driving and then killed someone by crashing into another car, this is a 3rd way it could have ended. To me, regardless, he literally fought those cops to not get arrested."
1425,1427,OMG
1426,1428,I just released gas from my ass details at 11!
1427,1429,"The police should just leave any black man to do what they want , this will prevent any issues"
1428,1430,These cops can‚Äôt fight
1429,1431,"When someone is driving while intoxicated, fighting police officers, 
running and firing a taser at the officer in pursuit, he was an imminent
 threat to the officers, the public, and himself before he stepped out 
of his vehicle."
1430,1432,I don‚Äôt see  this much danger where they had to kill a human being
1431,1433,"Breaking News Cop no longer goin to shoot u, so just go and take their guns"
1432,1434,So you get killed by police becuase you're drunk and slept in a car.
1433,1435,Drunk an out of control.resisted arest smart move buddy.
1434,1436,There is no life threat. No reason for killing.
1435,1437,"My step dad was a sheriff for 30 years. He‚Äôd just let the drunks run and watch as they‚Äôd gas out several hundred yards away. Later on he worked the K-9 unit for about 6  years and NOBODY ever ran or acted up. We cool. Problem solved, more police dogs. üê∂"
1436,1438,Weve got to get better non lethal measures.  Tasers dont work on someone under the influence and dont always work in general.  He should have his license revoked and be alive.  He was a danger but he shouldnt be dead
1437,1439,Just sad.
1438,1440,some black ppl always think they can run like Carl Louis after they realize the are going to jail.
1439,1441,"Big issue... Cops didn't even explain thoroughly to him why he was being taken. Definite feeling of ambush. But this man resisted arrest, got in to a fight with 2 officers, grabbed a taser, went running and while running turned back to shoot at a cop... That was the perfect recipe to get shot and killed. In these harsh times, they were better off letting him run and just using the info from his vehicle to track him down and arrest him within 48 hours."
1440,1442,Justified.
1441,1443,So you guys are literally just going to hide the part in every video showing him get the taser and deploy it at the officer? You realize a disabled cop = a perp with a gun right? So a guy who willingly commits a dangerous crime and assaults the officers and then uses a taser to try and stun the officer leaving a gun up for grabs doesn't deserve to die? My cousin got shot three times doing that shit any nobody batted an eye and he wasn't driving when he was approached.
1442,1444,This guy dumb why he resisted and grab the taser smh
1443,1445,Cops need so much better training
1444,1446,Death penalty for bad cops. Then this mess will stop.
1445,1447,"Does it seem he was running away,
not toward the police, so they had
both the distance and the advantage
to just aim low for his legs, not back?"
1446,1448,To all these people defending these police officers . Why is it so easy for them to bring in mass shooters with armed guns so easily but can‚Äôt bring this man who is intoxicated without shooting him? Also are they not taught to use non lethal force to apprehend or subdue a suspect ?
1447,1449,Let that man get food
1448,1450,Take their guns
1449,1451,"Never a good idea to take a cop‚Äôs taser and point it at him..,"
1450,1452,"1. Why is a non-aggressive individual under DUI suspicion being arrested and handcuffed? Why not just write him a ticket and put him in a cab home? 2. Why shoot someone who is running away with a limited range taser? There is something seriously wrong with the way police behave in the US. In Australia, that is standard procedure. Positive read out, off to the van, secondary test, fine, don't drive. In the UK and many parts of Europe police don't even carry firearms. Wild West attitude."
1451,1453,This is a private parking lot police are not supposed to be able to mess with a person
1452,1454,"I agree, he was wrong for firing the taser. But as a trained policeman you should know he wasn‚Äôt gonna get a good shot while moving....also he wouldn‚Äôt of got that far on foot....just call for back up smh"
1453,1455,Can anyone getting that full video about it because the video that a well nobody knows about how did it happened but everyone need to cooperation at telling the truth
1454,1456,So the story is. Don‚Äôt get in a fight with law enforcement. He lost
1455,1457,Why kill him?
1456,1458,american police is trigger happy bunch huh??
1457,1459,Lol what about the other cameras?
1458,1460,You don't shoot somebody cause you cant catch him cops are becoming mentally challenged
1459,1461,He shouldn't of ran away
1460,1462,"The officer didn't want to tase him that's why he was able to take the taser from the second officer. Literally officers don't want to hurt you and this instance is a perfect example. Yes he was armed, he had a taser. What if he'd tased that officer and then took his gun, he already stole a taser ffs."
1461,1463,"god damn it man. of course he shouldn't be killed by the police, but what did he achieve? just chill bro. well he's chillin in some other dimension right now. American police need better training. so sad"
1462,1464,"Hey Dana, why the looooooong face?"
1463,1465,Why would you cooperate then go ahead and not cooperate? His death is not the same as other police killings.
1464,1466,"Cops not hired to be Judges,
not hired to be Jurors,
nor hired to be Executioners.
Any Cop doing any of those actions"
1465,1467,If the cop was tased and dropped his gun or passed out...the CRIMINAL could of grabbed it and killed someone...justified
1466,1468,"So by this logic, every interaction if someone doesn't want to get arrested, they should just be able to run, fight the cops, steal shit from the officers and point a taser at them as well. Hmmm, ok"
1467,1469,"There are two cops who are trained to detain people. So the decide to shoot him? I don't care if the guy took a swing at the cops, they knew he didn't have any deadly weapons so why should they use deadly force?"
1468,1470,Why shoot. Cmon.. super unnecesarry
1469,1471,‚ÄúOne bad apple‚Äù
1470,1472,Foreal
1471,1473,CNN loves this
1472,1474,Taser less than lethal? U wanna get tase yourself?
1473,1475,So even CNN is not doing news right. I'm just gonna watch Trevor Noah.
1474,1476,"I watched the FULL VIDEO.. 
1) He did drunk drive. (Not sure how far, he was sleeping in his car,not properly parked)
2) he did resisted arrest.
3) He did grab policeman taser and shoot them when he was running."
1475,1477,Totally misreports this situation
1476,1478,All these people out there think it's okay to shoot a man in the back while he's running away from you. Damn.
1477,1479,Tell the whole story not half. Play the rest.
1478,1480,Don't resist and you won't be shot . How hard is that to understand?
1479,1481,Why can‚Äôt cops just except that there wrong
1480,1482,Why did CNN bother to post this clip? It's not informative and there's really no frame by frame analysis.
1481,1483,Maybe cop didn't know that black guy took he's partners taser. He shot him because he thought it was a real gun perhaps.
1482,1484,Hoax
1483,1485,Cnn just like drama ... .-.
1484,1486,He had their taser and could have harmed officers.
1485,1487,Even though he was in the wrong. Why do they always resort to shooting? They can‚Äôt run and tackle him? The cops in the show cops from the 90‚Äôs would run to tackle and not resort to shooting
1486,1488,"Great Job officers 
Stay safe"
1487,1489,"Yeah , the edited trusted name in CNN....."
1488,1490,Wtf is going on..they killed him. Period.
1489,1491,HEAT OF THE MOMENT
1490,1492,Don‚Äôt ever make an officer have to make a decision.
1491,1493,AGAIN
1492,1494,"These cops should be charged with 2nd degree murder. That was not self defense, it was murder. End of story."
1493,1495,Wht drive DUI?
1494,1496,The police shoot and killed a man who is unarmed and running away from the officer. Unbelievable.
1495,1497,The Wendys was burnt down by non protesters fyi
1496,1498,Edited by cnn...
1497,1499,"let him run, meet him later. whats hard about not chasing and shooting a drunk dude."
1498,1500,CNN is awful
1499,1501,Shortened & combined means: I am about to lie to you. We have to find the video for ourselves.
1500,1502,Those cops shouldn't have bothered that man. They were busy trying to make their quota. Cops should've drove him to his sister's house.
1501,1503,Why is utube not showing fox news comments
1502,1504,One last criminal like George Floyd hurray üëèüëçüòÇ
1503,1505,A New Law:  Resisting Arrest:  One Year Mandatory:  Then tack on the other charges.
1504,1506,Should have let him go.. When you know who he is.. Just go get him later.. Still alive!!
1505,1507,If he hadn't acted like a wild animal he would still be alive.
1506,1508,THEY SHOT A GUY FOR A DUI.  Thats insane
1507,1509,"How come a police can handcuffs a man for drunken drive offence. They are supposed to book a penalty and seized a car.....

Oh my god......üò≤üò≤üò≤"
1508,1510,There's two rules I don't care how loud you are and how proud Russia cop run from a cop you're going to get dropped so you should just stop what you opt out of life not in and I guess there's no seeing you again
1509,1511,"When black people get arrested they should have the option to flee if:
1) it's a white police officer performing the arrest
2) if the black man rather be somewhere else and does not want to entertain the cops at that time"
1510,1512,Shoulda just tracked him down for fleeing you had his car and camera footage showing he was a wanted suspect .
1511,1513,"Either way what do you think is going to happen when you point a taser at an officer duh, common sense people"
1512,1514,At this point just take the guns away from the police
1513,1515,"The US police training is an absolute joke. You put guns in the hands of people with 4 months of training and put them out on the street. In civilized countries, at 4 months of training, basic physical training begins. Maybe you should rethink your police schools strategy?"
1514,1516,"The kid was wrong, but doesn't mean you shoot him over a taser while he is running away."
1515,1517,"What happens if the cop was shot with the tazer and now is paralyzed, his life is now in danger."
1516,1518,Starting to think these news organisations are paying these cops for footage like this to create these situations.
1517,1519,Why did he resist?
1518,1520,It‚Äôs simple stop killing us. I don‚Äôt care if he ran away. That don‚Äôt give you the right to kill somebody
1519,1521,"This guy did not deserve to die, but why try to run? You think they are just gonna let you get away? Then you take one of their tasers and shoot them? What do you thinks going to happen after that? This is wrong on both sides please do not solely blame the cops for this."
1520,1522,Great video proof that police action was totally justified.
1521,1523,"I found the whole video online. He doesn't look like a bad cop to me. I know we expect of our officers not to turn a blind eye to a suspected drunk driver. The officer doesn't have a choice about that. We would fire him if he walked away. He conducted the questioning and field testing in a professional manner. He didn't appear to show any bias toward the man.  The man finally admitted he was guilty and failed the breath test. The man then made an unprovoked decision to resist. He also was able to get once of the officer's tazer. I know that is a non-lethal weapon but we expect our police officers to pursue a fleeing suspect. It would be wrong for him to let the a suspect escape. We demand our police officers to pursue and apprehend. I think if an officer is threatened with a taser, it isn't unexpected or out of the ordinary for the officer to draw his sidearm. If an officer draws his firearm then he shouldn't ever be expected to only bluff with it. He should only draw it when it is justified. I doubt that many police officers would threaten to merely taze him back. If the police officer is tazed and incapacitated, he could lose control of his sidearm too. There is no reason to trust that this man or any person would pass the opportunity by to take his side arm too especially since he already forcefully took the taser. I know he has a partner that possibly might prevent the man from also getting the sidearm but a complete risk analysis in the few moments that this took place is more than can be expected. I think is it tragic that this man died over this but I don't think it was bad policing. The police officer did shoot three times instead of just once but I think it is hard for people to have perfect control over their shooting in moments like this. I don't speak from experience but from what I have observed and learned about human nature in war and other situations involving firearms, people often shoot more than is truly necessary."
1522,1524,"Not condoning what he did, running away with a laser pistol and threatening to use it, is never a death sentence in any civilized society. I do not believe the cop's life was threatend whatsoever"
1523,1525,"""How did he get my partner's gun?"", he thought, then fired back."
1524,1526,By then I hope that I can run this great country in Jesus name!!!!!!
1525,1527,This makes sense. I was struggling with this one. But that last 20 seconds or so really drove the point home.
1526,1528,"In another earlier video to me it looked like he had a flashlight in his hand when he was running away from the cops.
You could see a light beam from his hand.
They just didn't want to have to chase him down."
1527,1529,For all those thinking this was justified actions please tell me what episode of the show Cops you seen when someone was killed for not cooperating? I'll wait.
1528,1530,"Excessive use of force. You can't say tasers aren't lethal when you shoot them at people and then turn around and be like ""This is lethal, I feared for my life, had to use lethal means to neutralize the suspect"". That policeman has no good excuses. His first mistake is loosing a weapon to the guy, his second one is shooting with a lethal weapon against a non lethal one when their lives clearly weren't in any danger."
1529,1531,So could he have been considered an imminent threat because he was in possession of the officers Taser and he could have used it against the officer to acquire the officer's service pistol which could have possibly resulted in the death of both officers and possibly innocent bystanders?
1530,1532,We should not over react. I believe they tried to do the right thing. Try to put yourself in their shoes.
1531,1533,"He drove under the influence, fell asleep in his car, resisted arrest, punched the police, stole a taser, upon fleeing turned and fired the taser at the police officer who no longer had the less lethal taser option."
1532,1534,So this police took out the video camera on purpose and put it on the ground so that nobody can see what happen?
1533,1535,I think the video I think this person has run at the same Time The Office was in Panic that's why I think the officer make the wrong choice to shoot them but it doesn't mean that person was wrong so don't come with your Justice because this is a different case
1534,1536,"He was in possession of the taser...his behavior was aggressive and violent...men have been known to kill people without weapons...and he was resisting arrest.  This guy is the only one responsible for his own death...people need to be accountable for their actions.  What, so criminals can just do whatever the hell they want with no repercussions?  This is ridiculous!  This is not the George Floyd scenario.  Peoples emotions are running high, and they are being very reactive instead of looking from a non biased point of view. If your son was the cop trying to arrest this man for drunk driving, and then the guy went off and stole his taser, then discharged the taser and was being belligerent and violent, I think your view would change.  Black lives do matter, but this is pretty cut and dry....this instance was not about race."
1535,1537,"I missed the part where that cop narrator said ""Those cops fucked up"""
1536,1538,"This obviously drunk man fought like crazy, and ran while having the taser he stole from the officers.
The man had enough strength to wrestle and muscle his way out while stealing the taser.
Then got chased down with another taser gun. You know what's dangerous? It's this crazy drunk tasering and stunning one officer, and having the chance to steal the gun. He was able to wrestle and succeed with a taser. That man has already proved himself as an extreme threat to the community."
1537,1539,"This is one ef up situation.   Don't know the situation but clearly the suspect was resisting arrest. 

In this case it does not help both sides at all.   The suspect was resisting arrest and like the comment says he took a taser from the police and shot them with it. I'll say if the suspect got the gun instead we'll have two dead cops.  "
1538,1540,"Perfectly justified.  Don't wanna get shot, don't take a police officers weapon and fire it at them.  This guy TOOK the officers stun gun away from one of the officers and then fired it at them as he ran away.  Anyone trying to make this out as him being unarmed is purposefully leaving out the truth."
1539,1541,"Very sad ending!   First of all, the suspect is mainly responsible for his own death.  Get out of the car and comply with the police.  You don't fight with the police, take any weapon and run. Yes, a taser can't kill you , but you mustn't take anything from the police.  What was the purpose of said action?!"
1540,1542,I just got done watching the entire video which was over an hour long. They were cool as hell with him . Pretty much he done fucked up himself.
1541,1543,thankful the cop had a good shot. it could of ended bad.
1542,1544,Por que se resiste a ser esposado?
1543,1545,"What was the Results of the Breathalyzer? That Officer used a Breathalyzer, and then put it
up and never showed the results. This is not correct procedure, Then Said
"" I Think You Had to Much to Drink"" That statement is an opinion......, What did the Breathalyzer show? You know it showed he was not intoxicated, otherwise he would have presented the ONLY Physical Evidence They had to prove there was a violation. That is why he kept asking him what kind of drinks, and how many. The Breathalyzer would have showed him intoxicated and that would be the end of the discussion. "
1544,1546,if you drive under the influence which puts other people in danger and then get punished for it that‚Äôs how life works. If you try to avoid said punishment and force an altercation like this then in the event you are shot and/or killed you brought all of it on yourself. Decisions have consequences
1545,1547,"This doesnt show what happened at all in the video from the front of the police car, it shows the suspect grabbing the taser out of officers hands and then shots it towards the other officer who has his taser out. The suspect misses and the officer misses too. Then the suspect attempts to flee with the taser hence the officer needed to shot him. Sad, avoidable but the officers were out of options."
1546,1548,"I‚Äôd like to see the part where he fails the sobriety test. 
All I see here is the man balancing on one foot. No idea how long he was doing it. Frankly, I can‚Äôt do that for very long on my best day, which would be under half a minute. 
Didn‚Äôt the thumbnail show a breathalyzer?  What was the reading?"
1547,1549,"to the cop that shot rayshard brooks , did it embarrass you of how he got your taser ? how do you feel after shooting and killing him as opposed to what all cops are trained to do? you should have wounded him , and if you need three bullets to wound a suspect , you should never have been allowed to be on the force in the first place . i find it hard to believe that you were that bad a shot."
1548,1550,He had no gun and ran away. You had the car which could possibly be traced back to his home. The shooting was not necessary.
1549,1551,"An extrajudicial killing (also known as extrajudicial execution) is the killing of a person by governmental authorities or individuals without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process. Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures."
1550,1552,resisting arrest may cost you your life...
1551,1553,Would if the suspect had successfully tased the officer incapacitating him suspect then is able to get his gun. Possible scenario. I though there was another cop. These decisions have to be made in seconds.
1552,1554,Good and bad in everyone. Even though there is a evil side of things
1553,1555,Worst video editing ever. I have seen way more footage & it is clearly justified. Video condensed = LIES
1554,1556,Two officers against one drunk person don't see much after he runs off if I know he only has a taser gun and ranning at me yea I'll be like holy crap but pull out my gun shooting the person nah . If he rans at your partner can tackle him down and arrest him if he runs off o well you call back up you got more cops looking for him
1555,1557,F!!!! THE POLICE!!! PERIOD!!!
1556,1558,"Why he resists ? 
Why he runs ?"
1557,1559,Try not breaking the law!
1558,1560,"Justifiable shot? Do you really think that it's edited so is a fake? Unedited full-stories from the families of the victims are being released. They had to know the fact only after 4 days from the death, and see the body after 8 days, and still were told no clue of the death. That's the reality behind the scene that can hardly happen If one ever mattered just as he does for their own loved ones. More and more proof of reality is coming up,"
1559,1561,"What wasn't shown is just before he was shot, he pointed the stolen taser at the cops. Did people expect the cops to let themselves get tased?
A couple of safety tips. When your being cuffed, don't resist. When you resist, don't steal a taser. When you steal a taser, don't run. When you're running, don't point the stolen taser at the cops. When you point the stolen taser at the cops, don't be surprised when they fire their weapon in defense. "
1560,1562,You don't need any editing or commentary to know what really happened if you watch the video in the following link - https://youtu.be/hnRuWcgflaE
1561,1563,"Someone decides to sleep instead of driving while drunk , and harm others , why don‚Äôt just let the man sleep, position the car so no one calls anymore , go about your day , or give him a citation, but NO let‚Äôs cuff him up , and he has a taser , A f**ing TASER , and is running away and the cop decides to switch , the taser to a gun which was already in his hand , to use deadly force , against someone fleeing. JUST THROW THE WHOLE BADGE AWAY AT THIS POINT ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1562,1564,If you are immobilized by a taser as an officer you could be shot.  The man is drunk and obviously his judgement is impaired.  If he gets the cop with the taser that could be very dangerous. Cop  would be immobile and the man could take his gun.  Also the clipped out where the man punched one cop in the face- it took 45 minutes.  There is a lot not showing -
1563,1565,"Is it possible for a policeman to shoot at a non-lethal area of a human being??? If they're trained to Shoot-to-Kill at ALL times, then this practice REALLY needs to change. How FK sad for this mans family. And if he just would have complied!!!!"
1564,1566,addendum: look at how many police for a (suspected) drunk driver - no wonder people are calling for a defunding of the police in some major cities.
1565,1567,Get the guns out of the hands of our police and citizens or we will keep having people reaching for an easy lethal win to their problems.
1566,1568,You resist arrest fighting the police take a officer's taser.  While running away you point that Taser at the police. Who is suprised he was shot ?
1567,1569,"The police stopped him and no doubt ask to see his drivers license and registration. I police also had his car with license plates and had him on video. The police also knew that he did not have a weapon, so why not let him run away and catch him later?"
1568,1570,How many cops are there? I think a saw 2. What BS cops do we have? 2 cops can't hold 1 man. Now I no why they are always afraid. That's what you get if you steel only the strong big black African.üòúü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
1569,1571,"He fought 2 police officers while under the influence and stole a taser from one of the officers, the man was a danger to the public"
1570,1572,People need to quit braking laws and they wont hafta deal with the police
1571,1573,How is your video quality so regularly terrible? Do you actually pay an editor or sound guy?
1572,1574,Well the officers are used to beating up black men two on one this time they met their match one man beat the crap out of the police took his taser and ran they were embarrassed and shot the man in the back the man was too strong for these officers and that shock them they met their match
1573,1575,He was ASLEEP! THEY WOKE HIM UP!! THAT WAS THE END!!!! So fucked up!! This is Stop and Frisk in 2020!!!
1574,1576,"So much violence I'll tell ya..  It's just hard to tolerate while your camping between a shoe store and a giant cat mural on the train tracks though!  If anybody ever did that...

@MyselfOneIII On Twitter"
1575,1577,"It makes me so sad to see that people think this is worth getting killed over. I'm not sure if it is just people picking teams to say things aren't as bad as black people have been saying it is. In this video the man talks about his daughters, remember the human element here. He should have been arrested, no one is disputing that. But to get killed over this, running away with a taser (while being under the influence) is egregious."
1576,1578,He could of immobilized the officer with the stun gun and took possession of his weapon. That is an imminent threat to the lives of the officers.
1577,1579,They don't know how to be cops
1578,1580,"You shouldn't use deadly force, but if he hits the cop with the tazet and then takes his gun? He had already taken the tazer. I just don't get why they don't just take one shot that isn't lethal. The guy would stop at that point."
1579,1581,"Don't resist arrest, follow commands, don't pass out drunk in your car and things will go smoothly. Dam idiots."
1580,1582,Ok the guy was in the wrong but why kill him? He was running away. You could catch him or pick him up later. Why is it always deadly force?  What happened to one shot as well? Now its a whole magazine for every misdemenour.
1581,1583,"For those of u asking why we want to see a different angle, is because it makes no sense for cnn to use this clip, which is messy, unclear, and hard to see what‚Äôs happening. I wonder why they did that? Cause there‚Äôs a much better, clearer clip that shows the whole thing, showing the guy resisting arrest, and attempting to harm the officers. But of course, that wouldn‚Äôt be good for cnn so they avoided using the better clip üòÇ"
1582,1584,"The officer was not in fear for his life , a taser does not kill you .
Ergo the officer killed him because he got his ass whooped."
1583,1585,"He was just scared. Why did the cops have to overreact like that right off? Everyone was polite and cordial up until Brooks panicked. It could have been deescalated. And so what if he ran off? They had his car and could pick him up later. Now one man is dead, and the two cops' lives are altered forever."
1584,1586,"Hate to say it but he deserved it.  He turned around, pointed the weapon at them, and even discharged the taser at the cops while running !!!"
1585,1587,"Once again.... another example of poorly trained police officers, A non compliant suspect and a system who won't do anything about it"
1586,1588,Re training is the answer... for future victims
1587,1589,Justified
1588,1590,Why do Police in the USA very quickly use guns?
1589,1591,"Why the hell are you running man smh! Wtf is the problem with our people, resisting arrest for what and running for what omgüò≠"
1590,1592,The worst part is now these videos are coming out in the open. With little to no action. This pretty flaunts how police officers can do what they want. We just want accountability. Plan and simple. If you do just the follow. 1) remove immunity protections for police. 2) Make sure officers are held accountable for there actions. 3) arrest and prosecute. 4) tell police unions to bugger off. 5) have another party investigate and hold accountability towards the officer or officers in question. 6) if terminated eveb if they are given hail sentence rumove pension and make it where they can never work in law enforcement or security. 7) remove privatized prisons.
1591,1593,üò¨üò¨
1592,1594,I think more less than lethal options could be utilized.  Search YouTube for Wrap Technologies‚Äô Bolawrap.   This could be an effective option for police.  This could certainly save lives.
1593,1595,I saw a tazer hanging from the cops belt.
1594,1596,"The trolls here don't seem to understand the LAW. As said in the video deadly force is only to be used if the suspect is threatening the LIVES of the officers or others. Even though the suspect got the taser from the officer it is not a deadly weapon capable of taking lives, so yes the cops WERE in the wrong here, according to the law."
1595,1597,"Keep protesting 
ACAB!"
1596,1598,Sounds like a lot of y‚Äôall should apply and go to work carrying out the duties of a police officer. Lol. Most of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even understand how a taser works and what could happen if a suspect uses a taser against the police. A taser doesn‚Äôt just hurt it makes all your muscles tense up and you can‚Äôt move. Then the suspect can take the officers firearm. A taser point at a police office makes for a deadly force situation.
1597,1599,"Cop should be charged with murder. They have his ID, They could have impounded his car and there is no chance of him doing any harm with his car. Then charge him with a dui and several other charges, he would have come back at some point asking where his car is I promise you. . I am sure it was embarrassing that two police cant handle one drunk man. BUT they have to stop training like there going to war.. They are much too trigger happy and the problem seems to be getting worse at a rapid rate. The man was sleeping in his car, seemed compliant abut made a poor decision maybe due to the alcohol.. I do not understanding shooting a man in the back because he is running from you.. Maybe he was in fear of his life.??? Very understandable. I have been in fear of my life with a gun on me by an IL deputy.. Middle of the day I pulled off the interstate checking to see if I had a flat tire, Look up and a revolver in my face. These cops have to stop watching John Wick."
1598,1600,No you edited it to fit your narrative
1599,1601,"The sad thing is,is he could have refused the breathalyzer.They were not sure what he was doing.They didnt suspect he was drunk at first.And they didnt catch him driver drunk either.Just parked resting.They didnt have to do anything but drive him home.Instead they chose to go this route smh."
1600,1602,SHOOT THE RESISTANCE!
1601,1603,POLICE Officers here in the mainland are suffering for lack of criminal law training . There was not a probable cause to provide a sobriety test. The individual was parked . As a former police officer I would just told him please park you vehicle in the proper parking and enjoy your nap . The reality on this case these two cops saw a black man in a nice car and automatically the racist thoughts came on their mine and cost their career . Please train the police better they are being victims of the states lack of preparedness . Politician get with John Jay College they have a great criminal justice program and puerto Rico state police academy train train train
1602,1604,He resist but NO weapon... No reason to shoot....
1603,1605,need the whle video man are you serious
1604,1606,This is why cops need to take Jiu-Jitsu/Judo or any MMA class so lethal weapons don't need to be used because even a taser can be lethal on someone with a heart condition.
1605,1607,"Now what dude did was stupid af. Drunk ppl do stupid shit i think we all can agree with that... But can we also agree that shooting for the legs is worth a try?? And lets keep it real, it was the heat of the moment but that guy was running with that yellow taser long enough for one to see that it was a taser that had been taken. You can see its a yellow taser hes running with even on the security cam footage"
1606,1608,Plz don't play victim card in the name of racism üò°üò°üò°üò°
1607,1609,I think they will get their jobs back.
1608,1610,Simple STOP! RESISTING arrest and acting like a DAM! FOOL making matters worse
1609,1611,"Far too often Police shoots a guy running away, cause they don't want to chase. You will eventually catch the guy. Sure, he took your ""Less Lethal"" from you; should he then be captured with a ""Most Lethal""?"
1610,1612,But again he shot his taser at the office or so the officer had legal recourse to shoot back
1611,1613,Charles ram-me huh üòè
1612,1614,"Why do they shoot to kill, why don't they just stun them?"
1613,1615,Most of these policies. Is just weak mindset. Same like how you have some black brother. Who are also weak minded. Will killed is brother or is sister without thinking. So we must also punish them the same way
1614,1616,Interesting how his bodycam came off ü§îü§îü§î
1615,1617,"this was justified force, he should taken the DUI."
1616,1618,"He armed himself with the cops teaser.
The teaser won‚Äôt kill the cop, but you have to think if he grabbed the teaser, and he shoot the cop with the teaser, what‚Äôs stopping him from going for the cops gun next? 
Everything was going good until HE wanted to fight with police.He should have just went to jail, I mean he was breaking the law drunk and passed out in a running car."
1617,1619,They had no reason to arrest him if he passed the breathalyzer.
1618,1620,Bro he was doing fine he didn‚Äôt acted all crazy wtf is up wit the cops !!!!!!!
1619,1621,Another tape shows the rest of the foot chase and the actual shooting.  Find that one for a better understanding.
1620,1622,"I watched 2 videos of two European Americans today. One just killed 3 people, naked and chasing a cop who had a shotgun in his hand! 2nd, 22 year old, chasing a cop after getting tazed. Ram his car into the cruiser, and took off when another cop arrived. Both are still alive and well. You can make all the excuses oe justifications but its all BS. WE are tired of being gunned down than ask questions later!"
1621,1623,They killed this man for no reason why wood you pick up your bullet after you shot him  I thought tacer were not dedlay I meenn he waset up close to them so why shoots him
1622,1624,Well I'll rather him sleep it off in his car than to drive and injure anybody....did anyone think he was just resting it off looks like he was minding his business
1623,1625,He committed suicide by cop it appears.
1624,1626,"cops are right this time !!! if you are drunk and driving , its time to go jail . unfortunately , its all dead man""s fault.."
1625,1627,Why did the police not just call this man an Uber and send him home? They seen he had no weapons he didn't commit any crime.
1626,1628,"don't punch cops and try and shoot them,this is all his fault,his actions led to all of this . stop blaming other people for what you do ."
1627,1629,The shooting was wrong plain and simple but the victim started things in motion. Should have just let them handcuff him and that would have been it. If the police had let him go and he drives off and kills some kids is it the police fault? They just couldn't let him drive off once they realize he was under some type of influence. As far the taser its not a deadly weapon but it can incapacitate someone that's why police use it. If used on a police officer it could knock the officer out cold then what? The officer is defenseless. Still so many things went wrong and another life has been taken.
1628,1630,"1. Why are you drinking and driving
2. That‚Äôs a threat to everyone on the road not just yourself
3. Why resist arrest when you know nothing ever comes good out of it
4. Why kill him when you know he had nothing that could kill you. And his only defense was the taser"
1629,1631,Stop resisting
1630,1632,Some folks just want to die. Why did he run? Why was he struggling? BTW I am black
1631,1633,A tazer
1632,1634,did he or did he not resist an arrest and attack police officers? that is how i feel about it
1633,1635,"::sigh::
If those cops had just not gotten him drunk and drove him to Wendy's, this wouldn't have happened..."
1634,1636,"This is not a black and white case! The police was in the right in just about everything here. He had fallen asleep at the wheel in the drivethrough because he had been driving under the influence. Instead of taking the DUI, he chose to fight the police and add resisting arrest to it. I might fault the cop for shooting at him when he was running and turned to aim the taser at the cop, but in that split second moment, it is difficult!t to even know what he was holding. There were several officers, what about if he had wrestled a gun from one of the other cops, and that was what he was pointing! The cops might need to review this for what they might need to change in their process, but I personally feel this enjoying was justified, and I'm sorry, a series of poor choices from this man led to his death!"
1635,1637,They a bunch of cowards to shoot a man in the back
1636,1638,"Why she keep sayin white officers ,the guy is a cop"
1637,1639,Well don't sleep at Wendys drive thru da fuk
1638,1640,Another public murdering.
1639,1641,Both sides wrong here.
1640,1642,"Sentence these cops to death penalty! Can't use the ""I thought it was my taser"" defense this time!"
1641,1643,"After seeing the full video, he did fought the officers and managed to take one of their tazer gun. All I can say is that there was no need to vandalized/burn that Wendy's, we need to stop this needless destruction of the community and if we want true change stop antagonizing that idiot."
1642,1644,"If you are a cop and you cannot handle arrest a drunk guy passed out in the Wendy's drive through you need to find another job.   He gets away from you so what?   You've got his car?    You chase after him so he does not injury himself by running into the street.   If he gets away so what?  For god's sake, he's driving a Toyota Camry."
1643,1645,No it wasnt closed sorry .
1644,1646,This is not the same case as Floyd's...
1645,1647,CNN will find a away to blame this on Trump as well
1646,1648,I am confused. 1) Why did the guy attack the cops and run? He was only going to be put in the drunk tank and at worst might have had his license suspended. 2) Why did the cops give chase? They had the guys car. Just let the guy go. Impound his car and get him later. 3) Why did the cops use a gun? The tazer is not going to kill the cop so why did he use a gun? I f people would just use their heads and not do stupid things then we would have a lot less of this nonsense.
1647,1649,Why do they shoot to kill? Why couldn't he be shot on the leg it or something if he must be shot???? I'm so sick of this!!!!
1648,1650,"For all you people stating ""he should not have resisted arrest"", just do not get it!  This man looked liked if they placed those had cuffs on him he was goning to die!  Blacks are scared for they lives with the slightest interactions with police officers...  The way the fist officer initially had control of the situation was fine, the second officer looked intent on escalating this encounter."
1649,1651,Using a taser isn‚Äôt imitate danger to an officer this guy literally explains it right here yet this comment warriors are still defending the cops
1650,1652,What a crap video. After 40 something minutes of video that‚Äôs what they show us?
1651,1653,He was parked. Now that more tape is available the police were wrong. This man was sleeping. So drunk or not he should have been left alone and alive.
1652,1654,"Dude resisted and stole an officer‚Äôs weapon. For fucks sake, where is the outrage in Atlanta when these young kids are out there killing each other? This is getting ridiculous, it‚Äôs tragic what happened but this whole thing is getting out of hand."
1653,1655,CNN justs adds to the problem.
1654,1656,"These Cops will go to Jail soon or later, and i hope they do."
1655,1657,Race baiting
1656,1658,Real Cops don't need use weapons!
1657,1659,So attacks cops steals taser gets killed whats rhe problem play stupid games u win stupid prizes
1658,1660,Show the WHOLE VIDEO - Yes this is not right what the cops did but still show ALL THE VIDEO
1659,1661,"I dont get this america. In France, they would not even hand cuff. if under the influence and you fail the breath test, you cannot go home driving, your car just get impounded and that is that for the night. Then you will get other things like you'd loose your license and or go before a judge. This was really uncalled for."
1660,1662,Wow CNN show the view where the guy has a taser pointed at the officers face.  Trash news.
1661,1663,"White officer said ""put your hand.s behind your back for me boy"" that means he already thought of him in a racial terms."
1662,1664,He is not drunk the police lie
1663,1665,Why did he do that he would still be alive he didn't have to die..He should off just calm down  ..
1664,1666,"Just because a person is not armed, doesn't mean they aren't dangerous. Those grabby things on your body? Yeah, your hands? They are indeed weapons."
1665,1667,ü§¶üèæProtesters def got this one wrong... smh
1666,1668,So let me get this strait he ran away no weapons he gets kill wtf
1667,1669,For all those saying fake news or not showing something: this says BODYCAM footage. We have SECURITY footage too. Please read and look at multiple sources before accusing fake news
1668,1670,I have never seen a man who has been charged with a dui in hand cuffs ever. !!!  But then again I am the only black person in town.
1669,1671,wtf did they release this to defend this man these cops clearly followed the rules and this man tried to run off with a taser gtfo
1670,1672,"I watched the fully video of the interaction. The guy who was shot was:
1. Clearly drunk, passed out in a Wendys drive thru
2. Got woken up and asked to park the car
3. Didn't even remember he was parked in the drive thru"
1671,1673,CNN we need the full clip... why editing the video..... is high time I stop watching CNN.. you want to pull AMERICA down...
1672,1674,him being unarmed changed as soon as he had the officer's taser.
1673,1675,Ok so what if he succeeded in tasing the cop then grabs his real gun then shoots both cops.
1674,1676,He dropped his body camera cause he knew he was gonna shoot him
1675,1677,I see cops here trying what the know best... lying.
1676,1678,Why don't you ever see Indians from India (some of whom are actually darker than some blacks) getting into situations like the above one with the police????????????
1677,1679,"Why anyone watches CNN is beyond me!  I'm just here because someone said what a bad coverage they did--had to see for myself.
Yep, this is not journalism."
1678,1680,YouTube Sucks
1679,1681,"Is it ever going to stop ?  This is not right,it's stupid and evil."
1680,1682,It's awesome we can have a play buy play. Wish the cops had that option. Same old thing. Resist take your chances. The cops knew this guy was strong and could possibly get a weapon. He could also smash your head in the ground or break your neck in close contact. He had a police weapon that could disable someone. Every cop deserves to get to go home every night after work. The victim controlled the narrative.
1681,1683,"Condolences to the family, very tragic.  Just to shed some unfair depth of our society today.  A white woman in Peoria Arizona was arrested for shoplifting and was able to run over a police officer after a struggle and is still alive and in custody.  This man was only sleeping in the Wendys drive thru, and his life was taken.  We need change."
1682,1684,"I understand the point about having to be an eminent threat in order to use deadly force. Why the hell did he refuse to be arrested. I might be mad at the cops because they shot him but I would be pissed at my brother if I saw this is how it escalated and the end result was him getting killed. Once the breathalyzer got you your done. Where the hell was he gonna run to. This situation shows that the office did improperly use deadly force. Cops should be held to a higher standard.  But this creates soooooo many opportunities for the opposing side to say look at him resist, look at him punch the officer in the face (if you have seen the other vids), look at him shoot the taser at the cops. WTF did he think was gonna happen at that point. Dammit manü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨"
1683,1685,"Genuinely surprised at the fact you didn't run  a crazy race baiting headline. If you covered all stories as openly and calmly as this you'd get way more respect. 
This was crazy and unfortunate but sorry a taser is armed and he could of used that to get a gun off one of the officers. He fought over a simple DUI. So sad for everyone involved."
1684,1686,"I am not the police, but one thing I know is, if someone is running away, you don't kill them, you chase them down. They found no weapons on him and the police were not in any immediate danger. This man's life mattered. PERIOD!"
1685,1687,"Idk what you expect when cops try to arrest you and you push them off and run.  Everything was fine until he realized he was going to jail. 
I wish he wasnt ever hurt or killed. But you cant resist arrest. They shouldn't have shot at him, he shouldn't have resisted arrest."
1686,1688,You know what Law & Order means Cops? A right to defend oneself in a court. Not an execution.
1687,1689,The last 4 seconds of this video is all you need to know. Shame it abruptly ends.
1688,1690,"I really don't think it was necessary to shoot him. I just don't understand why people are putting themself in that position running way, hitting cops, challenging them, etc. Let's not make it more difficult."
1689,1691,Well safe ti safe both cops will spend the next 25 plus years in prison
1690,1692,Hey Steven en how about you let us hear the actual video instead of playing it with this guy talking over it so we can't actually hear what's happening? Can you do is commentary afterwards? Is CNN not one of the top news networks in the world? Why is it that they can't figure this stuff out?
1691,1693,You would see incidents like these all the time on the show Cops. Something that could have been a funny video of a drunk man fighting cops and then getting caught later on turns into an execution. SMH.
1692,1694,"SMH. So they knew for a fact that he wasn't in possession of a firearm but instead let their ego get the better of them because he overpowered them. ALL Police Officers need to hit the gym, learn extensive self defense or whatever and most importantly be RETRAINED.  Even if he used the taser on the Officers,  it's less harmful than a gun. They use it on people all the time so now they get to feel what it's like. Plus, they have his car and information so let him go and pick him up laterü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. The man was sleepingggggg. Let sleeping dogs lie! He did less harm sleeping than driving while drunk."
1693,1695,"Traffic offenses in some developed countries are handled by CCTV and mailed fines. 
However, a minor traffic violation like a bad light bulb is likely to get guns drawn and unnecessary interactions with multiple police units turning up in gun republic."
1694,1696,C'mon man! You know the cops will kill you and you pass out in the drive thru and then run away like a slave ?
1695,1697,I applaud the officers for the way they handled this. You dont resist arrest because you're drunk. He even assaulted the an officer while trying to be contained and stole a taser and fired it upon the officer.  Everyone who thinks this was handle wrongly what if the story changed and the person driving drunk hit and killed someone then what... The outcome is sad but the person should of just went to jail his actions caused him to end up being shot and now he's dead.
1696,1698,Wow CNN way not to show the part of the man aiming the officers taser back at him. At that stage it‚Äôs justified. If the officer was tased the guy could easily have gotten his gun
1697,1699,"Cops where very nice and did everything by the book, funny how the family attorney last night lied and said the cops used force ."
1698,1700,Well spoken
1699,1701,"No need to shoot, he was unarmed (no guns) he stole a taser from them but he was running away from the police officers and not towards them, so no need to shoot with a deadly weapon!!! They had his car, so just run the registration number of his car and you'll definitely find him chilling at home, where you can fine him for driving under the influence of alcohol, that's it, problem solved, no one needed to die ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è police officers really need to update their training for dealing with unarmed citizens!!!"
1700,1702,"Lol CNN with the editing ? 
I'll wait for another channel ! Oh and by the way ! I'm from Philly ! Chief Ramsey what did you do for police training during your time in Philadelphia ? 
Not a damn thing ! "
1701,1703,So I was wondering when it was going to get to this point. First they are like black man is unarmed even if someone was fighting a cop and gets shot and killed. Now it‚Äôs yes he had a weapon but it was non lethal. Even though he fought the cop and took his teaser and pointed it at the cop which if he had hit the cop with it cop could of knocked the cop out and then the guy could of got the cops gun. I swear next time it‚Äôs going to be yes the black man had a gun but it was a small one with small bullets and the cops gun was bigger
1702,1704,"nicely done, ty mr ramsey and ms bash."
1703,1705,As many people who have ran away from the cops and they shoot this man! This is bullshit!
1704,1706,No bueno!  God help us all.
1705,1707,"Stop fueling the fire with half truths. Show the whole video, with the part where Rayshard Brooks takes the officer's taser and tries to use it on them. Maybe even include the part where officers try to keep Rayshard alive and stable until the paramedics arrive in an attempt to save his dumb ass."
1706,1708,"He shouldn't have resisted arrest,  shouldn't have been driving drunk, shouldn't have fought the cops,  shouldn't have stolen a weapon, shouldn't have drawn a weapon on them.

He left them bo choice."
1707,1709,"watch officer tautums view on this. U can see the guy steal the taser and run away, he then turns to fire the taser back at police and is then shot."
1708,1710,What about all the civilians that witnessed the abuse of power and wrongful use of deadly force. DUI means jail not the death penalty...they spoke to him for 20min he was calm...they shot him simply because they didn't want to run... amazing
1709,1711,"just casue hes fighting back which he shouldn't have done, that doesn't mean he deserves to get his life taken from him. Like imagine if this was a civilian fighting a civilian, n one of them just pulled out a gun n killed the other. What is that? Its still murder, u dont just get some free pass, n that's what cops have been getting for years n years, straight passes becasue there badge protects them, which is not right, no matter who u are u serve that crime, no excuses. Keep in mind too that they checked this man for weapons also n there was nothing so its not like he was gonna start taking shots at them. All they had to do is just resecure him and take him to jail for extra time casue u obv cant just fight the cops like tha n try to run. But what I'm mainly saying Is that he did not deserve to get his life taken away from him"
1710,1712,"If he was running away they were in no danger, just mad at themselves for losing control.
This is another murder if he died?  They could of ran after him, he was running because he knew
he was intoxicated and didn't want to face charges but you don't start shooting."
1711,1713,"Wow,super ,super power ."
1712,1714,The criminal stole the officers taser and tried to shoot it at him! What if he had and then stole the officers gun?? The officers life was on the line. He should not have been fired.
1713,1715,"I‚Äôm pretty sure deadly force was warranted because if the cop was tazed the suspect, who was already violent, could grab his weapon and put more people in danger.  Hopefully we learn more.  Moral of the story is, don‚Äôt fight with the cops.  Don‚Äôt commit crimes and you‚Äôll never have to be in that position."
1714,1716,"What he did, stealing a cops taser or even shooting the cop with his own taser, he wouldn‚Äôt have been given the death penalty in a court of law. So yeah, I‚Äôd say excessive use of force"
1715,1717,"I understand BLM and the protest but being an officer is an incredibly difficult job done by incredibly ordinary people. This is a bad example of police brutality IMO. Nonetheless, he shouldn‚Äôt have died. But thats with the advantage of hindsight."
1716,1718,"More questions than Answers here. 
1. Is it illegal to sleep while parked with the engine on?
2. Was he asleep or did he pass out? 
3. Why resist arrest ?"
1717,1719,How are they releasing evidence to the public !!
1718,1720,"I have been tased on several occasions
 but I never thought to kill a police officer"
1719,1721,"Drunk driving, resists police, fights police, tries to taser cop. What would you do as a cop?"
1720,1722,A little common sense should have guided these officers.   You have the man's car.  If he ran off he will eventually come back for the car.  That the emotions went from zero to 100 in 5 seconds suggests that this man feared for his life.  It may have triggered a similar encounter with police.   When will the police force quite employing men with arrested development?
1721,1723,"I'm thinking a GREAT lesson literally everyone can learn is, if you choose to not get into a brawl with police officers and fight to steal their weapons, while intoxicated,  your chances of survival go up exponentially.  Crazy concept to put together but...I'm betting he'd be alive had he not decided to get into a fist fight while drunk, with the cops.   I could be wrong but...I'm just glad all those people at Wendy's lost their jobs now, who have families to feed.  Makes sense...yeah..."
1722,1724,"Why didn't they show the part where he was speaking to them, admitted that he had a couple drinks, told them he had no problem walking home and that his sister lived close by. He tried to reason with them and they still insisted on arresting him."
1723,1725,"Looks to me that the drunk guy chose to fight the police.....stupid drunk guy caused his own death.
And I‚Äôm a liberal person. We should choose our battles better."
1724,1726,"He got what he deserved. A guy driving under the influence, resisting arrest, taking the cops taser, shooting it at the officer and attempt to get away. What else do you expect?"
1725,1727,Damn is it so hard to bring someone in alive and not kill them. Seriously this is exactly why people are saying defend the police.
1726,1728,In my opinion I think it's a reflex those cops have when anything is pointing at them. He should of just took the DUI and the 5000.00 year fine for 5 years.
1727,1729,"No need to shoot the guy running away from a drunk driving situation. You had his car you knew who he was.he was drunk, no real harm to anybody he would have went and passed out under a bush somewhere and you guys would have found them again. Stop The killing of innocent black men !!!!"
1728,1730,If he is running away from you he is not a threat there for deadly force is not needed.  Let the guy run away you would have caught him later and he would be still alive.
1729,1731,Maybe police should just handcuff people to their car immediately without getting out.
1730,1732,"NO ONE, regardless of race, colour, or creed, has the right to resist arrest, to assault police officers, or to steal an officer's weapon (gun, baton, Taser, etc.). You don't have a right to lay one finger on a police officer (or to dump buckets of water on an officer, etc. as we've seen recently) because that is ASSAULT and stealing a weapon is THEFT and ASSAULT and therefore, police are fully justified and authorized to respond with the use of deadly force if necessary. "
1731,1733,"The young man was woke out of his sleep with no firearm. Have you ever been awaken so forceful? 
Something else to make him run. Just another murder to add to the list"
1732,1734,Was he in a drive thru?
1733,1735,Here is a tip have the first 5 rounds rubber bullets and the rest are regular rounds
1734,1736,"Resisting arrest should never have a consequence of the death sentence.
No jury+No judge+no fair trial
= NO JUSTICE!!!
no wonder good people are turning to the streets in violence. "
1735,1737,Such a shame. Police officers need to go through intense Psychological evaluations before they get a badge. Only a stupid coward with no healthy judgment will shoot a person in this situation. My deepest condolences to the family
1736,1738,Where‚Äôs the body cam I wonder?!
1737,1739,First of all he wasn‚Äôt on a main road to ask him to pull over.
1738,1740,They knew he didn‚Äôt have a weapon because THEY PATTED HIM DOWN. Absolutely NO reason no excuse to use deadly force on a man who‚Äôs unarmed and running away from police. I
1739,1741,"Ok now it‚Äôs two police officers and ‚òùüèΩ person of color. Now read the previous sentence again. WE ARE POWERFUL and they are afraid. Now this man wasn‚Äôt harm or anything, just a little ü•¥ cmon now and the police just shot him! No justice and it‚Äôs time to get peace! God helps US ALL #PrayersToHisFamily #ATLPeaceToYouALL ‚úùÔ∏èüôèüèæ‚ù§Ô∏è"
1740,1742,#RampGate is trending üòÇüòÇ
1741,1743,Never point an object at an armed police officer or anyone else for that matter
1742,1744,Sick 1619 to 2020
1743,1745,He should not have resisted arrest. If he can take the officer's taser he can use it on the officers to take there fire arm. That is a life threatening situation by an individual who was clearly under the influence and not in his right state of mind.
1744,1746,"Wrestled 2 cops, was drunk and asleep in a Wendy‚Äôs parking lot, took a taser from a cop and started running. Wow I wish I had the IQ if this guy"
1745,1747,This is democracy.. what is democracy?
1746,1748,He will be charged Wednesday!
1747,1749,He got the cops sfun gun from him and turned to shot cop with it in full videp.  Cop thought it was a gun im sure.   Cnn.   Only shows parts of video.  And why   fight with 2 cops.  That would put me on high alert if i was the cop..
1748,1750,So he was going to be charged for driving under the influence. So why did he start resisting right away? As far as I'm concerned he escalated the situation. Grabbing for the taser or could have been worse grabbing the gun.  Self defense on the officers part. Ridiculous
1749,1751,"If you don't want to get shot don't drink alcohol, fall asleep in your car, fight the police and use their taser against them... you know the risk surely? Have some personal responsibility."
1750,1752,#i can't breathe
1751,1753,Its really simple.. you let them arrest you and if you think cops did you wrong fight it in court....whats so hard about it.....stupid
1752,1754,Did he grab the gun during the struggle? Does anybody know?
1753,1755,"I don't care about somebody regardless of race, colour, or creed who wrestles and punches police to resist arrest or someone who steals the officer's firearm or Taser. When one assaults a police officer and/or steals the officer's weapon, one has basically forfeited one's life. All that guy had to do was cooperate with police and head off to the station or he could have stopped running and raised his hands to surrender, but he refused to do those things. He'd be alive today if he had done that, so any Black Lives Matter or Leftist radicals that don't think police have a right to enforce the law and to defend themselves can go to Hell. This is not the same situation as George Floyd at all; not by a long shot."
1754,1756,Was the guy driving? I thought I heard the cop saying  that  he was sleeping.
1755,1757,some police chief they're interviewing
1756,1758,Love how cnn doesn't show the man clearly turn around as running point the taser at the cops face at which point he is shot. ALL CLEARLY ON WENDYS OUTDOOR CAMERA
1757,1759,Apparently a taser is a deadly weapon.
1758,1760,Wait how did the body cam manage to be taken off? Smh like what? Lol
1759,1761,I am not sure I understand. He might be under influence but he‚Äôs not driving. Probably doesn‚Äôt want to drive to not cause trouble?!
1760,1762,They shot him in the back because he made them look silly.  They knew they weren‚Äôt in danger!
1761,1763,I guess you don't try to taze the police.
1762,1764,"Make your videos louder, it is 1/2 the volume of the other videos on YouTube"
1763,1765,Who was the fool who called the police in this situation? Couldn't you have gone and knocked on the window to wake him up yourself??? We got itchy 911 fingers. Let's change that first!
1764,1766,cop need to put put up thire guns if thire getting out of control
1765,1767,resisting arrest does now warrant losing your life
1766,1768,But he took the taser and used it against the chase so why was he running if he is so innocent ... grow up people
1767,1769,Please show the  body cam that can tell the entire story
1768,1770,Police academy's should have a four ye
1769,1771,Okay he was drunk and sleep but I don‚Äôt think that man should have had to lose his life everyday I see somebody getting beat down or killed by the police when is it gonna üõë
1770,1772,My common sense says this is murder pure and simple.
1771,1773,That shooting was inevitable. He was resisting and escaping arrest and stole a taser. He was a danger to the community . What if this guy comes entering to your home and with a taser? Don‚Äôt blame the police
1772,1774,good job APD
1773,1775,"But why couldn't he just comply with the police, he would still be alive if he would have"
1774,1776,Why are the networks not showing the beginning of video?? He was not confrontational and offered to walk https://www.facebook.com/livepolicepursuits/videos/rayshard-brooks-shooting-police-body-camera-and-dash-camera-footage-released-in-/314182192930885/
1775,1777,Murder !!!!!
1776,1778,why did the officer feel like he deserved to die wtf
1777,1779,"Why the F try to arrest the man? What the hell did he do? Clearly not drunk or anything, is not aggressive, has no weapon nothing at all and he Cooperates completely. Why on earth try to arrest him in the first place (not even talking about the shooting). Why not have a normal chat. Check why he was stopped in the middle of the street and then let him go. What kind of training did these police officers get? Nothing but some target practice it seems. Unbelievable."
1778,1780,Poor Wendy what did they ever do to deserve this treatment
1779,1781,Unnecessary killing.
1780,1782,Yeah man. Because resisting is totally what you want to do
1781,1783,DID NOT have to kill him!
1782,1784,"ü§îü§îü§îresist, fleet and try to use police stunt gun?? ü§îü§îü§î‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†"
1783,1785,Why have they not said if he would of let them put the cuffs on he would be alive now
1784,1786,"But if he runs, they will have his car and items within."
1785,1787,CNN: Helping people Understand what they are looking at. Did you see The WTC Mega Ritual as explained by CNN?
1786,1788,But why did they burn the wendy's?
1787,1789,He deserves arrest but doesn't deserve death.
1788,1790,They conveniently removed their body cams before they murdered this black man!
1789,1791,"They could have let him go,  get him later without Killing him."
1790,1792,Is this good?
1791,1793,So quick to render the Death Penalty.
1792,1794,That look like he had a phone w the flashlite on not a taser.  Lies
1793,1795,"Police banged on his window 
No reason to shoot to kill another black man driving his car, have the police learned anything?"
1794,1796,Why did they approach him in line at a drive thru to begin with. Let‚Äôs look at that trivial reasons Black people are approached by police in the first place. Sandra was arrested because she didn‚Äôt use a turn signal to let a cop car pass.... maybe he was intoxicated but how can you tell from him sitting in a drive thru???
1795,1797,He fled. So he got shot. Too bad. Just get arrested. He was drinking and driving.
1796,1798,This cops life was not in danger if the man was running away
1797,1799,Drunk guy with taser does not justify deadly force. They already searched him so they knew he had no weapons. This was another murder.
1798,1800,Murder over a non accident dui crazy
1799,1801,Pigs.   Guns Are Trouble!
1800,1802,Drawing your gun Should always be the last resort..
1801,1803,It looked like he had something in his hand when he turned and pointed at them it‚Äôs not fair to the process of getting justice if we lie/omit information regarding the situation.
1802,1804,Fox news turned off comments.. lmao
1803,1805,Why would you kill someone that was running away????? Unarmed. Racist ppl in comment section saying he shouldnt run like wtf is wrong with you ppl!
1804,1806,After using shoker the criminal could take aways policeman's gun and shot him.
1805,1807,Cnn report the full story. What are you trying to do here?

1808,1810,"Cops are only supposed to approach with a taser if someone is fighting arrest and threatening them physically, which was true in this case. When an officer is under physical threat, he has the right to fight back.  Cops put themselves in harms way each day to enforce the law, and they have the right to go home at the end of the workday to see their family. A person fights cops at their own peril. "
1809,1811,Why do they shoot people for running? Shouldn‚Äôt be able to do that.
1810,1812,JUSTIFIED
1811,1813,Love to see that lebron James has to say about this one
1812,1814,"They knew he was unarmed, attempting to flee, and the only thing he tried to use against them was their own weapon that is specificslly designed to be non-lethal.  He didn't deserve to die."
1813,1815,Why not tell the guy first that he is under arrest and the reason why instead of just slapping the cuffs on with no warning. May have been a different outcome
1814,1816,It‚Äôs was the most justified shooting ever. He shot a taser at a cop. How is this a controversy?
1815,1817,Tf u see this
1816,1818,"It‚Äôs a tragedy when anyone is killed by police..... but if you resist arrest, steal the cop‚Äôs tazer, run, then turn around and aim the tazer at the cop..... what do you expect? Cause and effect."
1817,1819,"Guy definitely escalated the situation. Gatta give the cops that. However, stop shooting people! So the drunk guy gets away. You have his car right there. And if it isn't his car, put out a warrant and find the guy. It's not like he was Eating people, dude was just sleeping in his car. I work at Wendy's. We see people passed out in the parking lot sleeping off a night all the time. Better that then driving home drunk. Shame the dude didn't make it to a parking spot. RIP, and love to his family. Another easily avoided death."
1818,1820,Justified
1819,1821,Play stupid games you get stupid prizes
1820,1822,"Unarmed, but resisted. He didn't need to be shot, tased at the worst. This is what caused the riot (not protest) at that Wendy's."
1821,1823,"My opinion on this video is the black man is breaking the law, but as he DID NOT have to die, I don‚Äôt understand why police need to shoot to kill instead of shoot a leg or somewhere you know the person will survive. One time I called the police for help cause someone was pointing a shotgun at me, I was with my son and when the police arrived, like 4-5 cop cars, they got out of their cars and pointed their guns at my son, I was so terrified, I start telling them we called you, the man with the shot gun is over here. That could have costed my son‚Äôs life because police just come and ready to shoot without even knowing what‚Äôs what."
1822,1824,He wasnt driving !
1823,1825,He was attacking the cop first
1824,1826,"The cop was wrong and should be arrested for murder. Cops need to be trained to control their anger. That said, every one of these recent examples of violence against blacks could have easily been avoided if the victim had complied peacefully or hadn't decided to act violently himself."
1825,1827,So now we're justifying a drunk driver who beat up cops stole their taser ran away turned around and fired the taser at the cops.
1826,1828,And to think all he had to do do was comply. Brothas never want to comply and when you use force they scream racism
1827,1829,"Why shoot a man without weapons? 
Who is running away?
THEY MURDRED THIS MAN"
1828,1830,You don‚Äôt know if he was going to jump in to someone's vehicle and try to run away and hurt somebody. This guy did everything wrong.
1829,1831,"When people are afraid of what happens to them once they are handcuffed, like you know, being strangled, they are going to freak out. 
FTP"
1830,1832,"Dui, resisting arrest, and using an officers weapon against him. I don't think its his skin color"
1831,1833,he grabbed the officers tazer and armed himself. stop lying to the people.
1832,1834,Defund the police üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è with losses of pensions act for corruption reform!!!!!!!!
1833,1835,Murder.
1834,1836,He was not blocking the drive thru. No reason to call police for getting him away.
1835,1837,He had nothing on him and he got shot in the back and died.  These cops should be fired.
1836,1838,"You also left out the part where the drunk guy punched the cop and fractured his jaw. Propaganda, inciting violence.  Wendy's should sue CNN."
1837,1839,Seems like the US Police could learn from some European countries that don‚Äôt carry weapons.
1838,1840,The cop killed that man should be guilty and gets the death sentence other sentence means the justice system is corrupted .
1839,1841,Did you forget about the 40 minutes the cops spoke with him and he lied to every question? The cops handled it extremely well. That guy was not co-operating at all.
1840,1842,"If you watched the whole video, this man was complicit and as nice as possible but they antagonized him constantly and looked for whatever reason to arrest him, he was already pulled over and was sleeping to not drive drunk. This was unnecessary and shows that there are 2 types of laws being used when it comes to color of your skin."
1841,1843,Always film the cops.....you just might save a life.
1842,1844,In panic mode you can't run.. i know its your first instinct to run but you can't run.... grabbing the stun gun was a bad move . The officer shouldn't of killed him but he was probably in frantic mode and then seeing the guy turn a stun gun on you..  you have to protect yourself.
1843,1845,"This is when police need composure, I understand both sides, but still ones life should be above everything. In today‚Äôs technological advance they should have some other tools that can neutralize any resistance. Taser is not enough even if used."
1844,1846,"three shots in the back of an drunken and running away guy, who you have on tape and his car. there is really something wrong with america ... everybody who doesnt understand why people are asking for defunding the police, are just stupid."
1845,1847,"The guest is over looking a very important factor.....When an officer possesses a firearm, the possibility that the firearm may be rendered from them and possibly used to kill them MUST be prevented....it is not simply a question of whether or not they had a reasonable fear of death based on a lethal weapon being possessed by the suspect or not....there was a GREAT potential of the police officer becoming ""Incompasitated"" from being struct by the taser by the suspect , and then having their firearm taken from them and used to kill them......An officer would have to use lethal force to prevent that from occurring....that is very reasonable....Sad to say, but that is what this case is going to come down to....from what I'm seeing (and although I'm black and I support BLM movement, where it is merited...because certainly there are cases of racial bias) this doesn't fall under what we're addressing, these officers treated this brother in a reasonable manner, I have to be honest....this appeared to be what is textbook police work!"
1846,1848,"So I'm Canadian. Last summer I was found passed out drunk in my driver's seat in a parking lot, the cop found me,called me a cab, put me in the cab, I arrived home save, and the next day I went to pick up my car and I had no fines and no tickets mailed to me. I will forever be grateful of that cop for making sure I got home safe."
1847,1849,"I have seen videos of people threatening cops with knifes, machetes and one where a woman resisted arrest and kept kicking the cop even after being tased twice and in NONE of these situations did the cops shoot them so why after tasing this man did they have to shoot him???"
1848,1850,All you have to do is cooperate and do as the cop says and nothing will scalate. And definitely don't reach for what ever the cops have on there belts
1849,1851,"It was going so well...
Why doesn't he just go to the police station?
I'm split on this one.
What the officer does is done as a product of his training."
1850,1852,"Yeah we know what happened. Brooks drove while intoxicated, lied to police, and then assaulted both police officers. 
Hard to blame alcohol for that kind of behavior. 
But then we live in a ""Post Modern, consequence free society!""üëå"
1851,1853,"Ok, 1: cops did pad down and found nothing.  2: suspect makes sudden move while cops are handcuffing, they rustle and cop uses taser first.
If you're the cop, when the suspect who was compliant so far makes a sudden move and resist, in that instant do you think ""we padded down he has no weapon"" or ""this guy might be hiding a weapon"" It's something to think about."
1852,1854,Why did he have to resist arrest and grab the taser from the cops and use it against them? He was clearly DUI so he should have manned up and owned up to his mistake and just complied. If he did he would still be alive.
1853,1855,"Yes, he should've had force used against him to detain him. But we can all agree there's a limit. 

For the people who said he was resisting arrest, if this was your family member, would you say oh man, too bad he resisted arrest or he'd be alive today.. please."
1854,1856,Theres injustice everywhere. We all gotta find a way together. Tough for me too
1855,1857,"I came with an open mind, but what would you think if it was yourself. There was no threat to the officers. How does this keep happening in the US. What were they thinking."
1856,1858,"I am against police brutality, but no ones talks about the killings of policemen trying to do their job!
The police force should protest as well!
So much crimes are being committed every day in this country, the police are overwhelmed!"
1857,1859,"There's no such thing as a ""deadly altercation"" CNN. An altercation is a loud argument and, to my knowledge, no one has ever died from being yelled at."
1858,1860,"CNN show the other part instead of lying, trying to make it seem like he was being innocent!"
1859,1861,"idk , who to blame ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
1860,1862,So never mind that he was drunk driving and resisting arrest violently then add battery on an officer and pointing a weapon at an officer let's not talk about that. C'mon man I agree that we need reform across the board from local all the way to the top of the government. But don't try to twist shit and make him an angel now. If were going to hold others accountable let's start with ourselves and our communities.
1861,1863,"Only one police officer had body cam? Where is the footage of the one that didn't ""fall off"""
1862,1864,"The police needs to be representative of the community they serve. There should be a big push for residents of a community to join law enforcement. When the people of the pd are members of the same community they serve, things like this would probably not happen. Also, because white police officers are trained to see black males as intimidating and as a threat."
1863,1865,"I think I am most disturbed that I scrolled comment after comment and no one even noticed that the officers did not tell him he was under arrest. This ends dramatically different if they inform him of what is happening and there was no reason to think that he wouldn't continue complying as he had to that point. If there are just two things that any cops should know it should be conflict deescelation and how to legally arrest someone ""Sorry sir, you know what you did is wrong , were going to have to place you under arrest "
1864,1866,"Shooting a drunk man, who didn't want to go to jail.  Something about that doesn't sound right. Some people run when being arrested because being arrested is terrifying to some people."
1865,1867,"What a joke.  Why did he freaking run?! He was over the damn limit!
Screw your theory of him not having a weapon. He broke the law"
1866,1868,"So you can fight the police, take his taser, and your shocked when you get shot? Come on people. If he wouldn't have done that he wouldn't have been shot."
1867,1869,"Look man we can‚Äôt justify him running . You were drunk why run . He grabbed the taser. And shot it at the officer. Now look the cop should‚Äônt kill him 

Taze yes. "
1868,1870,"Apparently it was Not his lucky day by His own decisions....a stun gun, I assume is a weapon and the slim chance of that being a second firearm....Police Chief resigned -good.
Support Good Cops....He totally put himself in that tragic but very sad situation.....  This is going to be interesting result...Please fn Rainbow STOP resisting."
1869,1871,"Be patient and considerate.
Some cops are so dehumanized they're like robots.
It's almost like they shoot on command.
It's Ridiculous."
1870,1872,Damn I guess he's a danger to the cop just for merely being black and committing a minor offence...
1871,1873,"there needs to be a new law that if you're able to wriggle free from tyrannical cops, then you're free to go. AND the cops need to undergo endurance training and get reprimanded.. publicly"
1872,1874,This has to stop... Holy hell... Why shoot him? I thought cops were supposed to only use deadly force ONLY when REQUIRED too.
1873,1875,"Apparently we still need to remind the police that their job is to enforce the law, not punish the offenders!"
1874,1876,"It's not like the Cops will escort him home with their flashing lights.
Next time before you call the cops  give the guy the opportunity to clear the way and park his car.
Or your Wendy's will be torched."
1875,1877,kinda hard to tell what happend after the body cam was dropped so i mean something could have happened that we didn‚Äôt see but from what i see it wasnt really necessary
1876,1878,"There have to be a better protocol, something other than shooting to kill. I don‚Äôt see this happening in other countries. We have a problem here in the US. The trigger as a response to everything, not to wound but to take out."
1877,1879,"Why did they have cause to handcuff him?  They should have cited him and asked him to leave, for sleeping in his car in a private parking lot. He looked like he had had too much to drink or was exhausted and wanted to park and sleep. I beleive that at that point , he knew that they would kill him. Adrian is in over flow, and it's  fight or flight. And they said he had stolen the taser, well if he was running forward with it, how do they justify shooting him in the back? You can't point a weapon at some one and run forward too. They unlawfully shot him."
1878,1880,"He wasn't passed out drunk at wendys. This was recorded at a college, and he was passed out from exhaustion from studying to be a nuclear engineer!"
1879,1881,"So wrong!!! It does not call for them to shoot him. His car was still there, they could send out a warrant for his arrest that way..plus he had no weapons on him. Plus they did not even tell him what they were arresting him for or read him his Miranda rights. They just want to arrest every black man and give them a criminal record  as much as possible to ruin their chances of a normal life."
1880,1882,"He should not have been shot...PERIOD. I watched the ENTIRE video. Yes he had the officers taser; I would like to know how much damage one can do RUNNING AWAY pointing a taser? I'm sure the officers were not happy he overpowered them both and got away. I believe he should have been arrested if he was driving under the influence but NOT KILLED. I don't want to hear any ""He should have complied bullshit either"" we all know how ""Complying"" works out for POC. This is just sad.. so damn sad. My heart breaks knowing that these were his last moments."
1881,1883,This is why defunding police and channeling money to health care and possibly other social service units is important. After patting him down they could call a health care worker and take his car key. Seeing a health care worker would definitely calm someone down and make eager to get actual help if necessary instead of panicking! When people demand to defund police they do it for obvious reasons.
1882,1884,"They seem to have left out a very significant portion of footage.
https://youtu.be/rIBoW4dcaAw"
1883,1885,People suffer consequences of police incapability.
1884,1886,Nothing worth killing forüòí
1885,1887,"I imagine if 'pain compliance techniques' we're used in Afghanistan or Iraq, we'd call it torture. Also, fearing for your life, from a taser, with your partner right next to you? GTFO."
1886,1888,What was their probable cause for pulling him over?
1887,1889,Nobody asked what was the reason for handcuff in the first place?
1888,1890,He probably tired from work fell asleep in a long drive thru line unarmed being pulled over in a drive thru with all the events taking place the last 30 days fears for his life runs away gets shot in the back homicide and charge the other with an accessory
1889,1891,"The fact CNN shortened, and compiled, the video is problematic. And if the body cameras captured the moment Brooks shot the taser, yet CNN didn't show it, it shows an egregious lack of journalistic integrity."
1890,1892,It is why we need to demilitarize the police because it has gone too far. ‚ÄúThey think they are warriors but there is no war.‚Äù -Beau from the 5th Column (aka Justin King).
1891,1893,This would never happen if these people wouldn‚Äôt be criminals and follow legal orders. In a heated moment anyone can use deadly force because your brain has very little time to react to the situation. This could easily be avoided if he wouldn‚Äôt have resisted arrest and disarm an officer of its side arm. To me he got what was coming to him.
1892,1894,We didn't see the whole story!
1893,1895,"I bet Wendy's burn smell like beef and all the pothead crying for loosing 5 nuggets for $1 connection at midnight.
That man doesn't have to die. From small potato to no potato."
1894,1896,"So he breaks arrest obtains officers weapon and there is no threat? What. If took the firearm making judgements over camera footage while comfortably at your desk , take into account wanting to go home to your family in split seconds with someone having a weapon pointed at you with no limits in what actions he is willing to take grabbing an officers weapon and be shot and killed is self-defense on the officers part he didn't initiate a stop on racial profiling the fast food workers could tell he was passed out he brought himself to this conclusion an unfortunate event but ultimately avoidable by his decisions"
1895,1897,Why did he resist arrest? Thats why they get killed !!! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1896,1898,"People the real truth, he was accused DUI and failed the test, after which he resisted arrest assault two police officers,  punch & stole one of them taser. while the other gave chase he turns and fired the taser. Is said had hit the officer what was his next move. Remember people a taser is designed to disrupt voluntary control of muscles, causing ""neuromuscular if this had hit the officer who would've stopped him from taking the officers gun and killed the both?I only see at that point in time that deadly force was necessary to save two lives, just take a ticket and live another day. Am tired of this SHIT NOW!"
1897,1899,"Now what would have happened if they just let him run? They had his car and probably his ID, what would have possibly happened?ü§î"
1898,1900,"Risist arrest, you risk your life. 
Attack police, you risk your life. 
I hope the police officer sues the department that fired him."
1899,1901,no reason to use deadly force
1900,1902,Don't worry police officers our government will invent a much stronger taser or a more stronger tranquilizer that's something that's needed
1901,1903,"Wtf you don‚Äôt shoot someone for drunk driving wtf you could have just waited and picked him up at home , he has to go home wtf . These police officers should be fired that‚Äôs exactly what disturbing us , the police have to respect for life . They had his car , he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere ."
1902,1904,Using a taser is not considered lethal force WHEN TRAINED....how to use it .....there is a reason you do not deploy it above the neck.  But used by someone without training....can be deadly..imagine getting those taser prongs in the eye....followed by 5 seconds of stunning electricity.
1903,1905,"In the USA cops shoot first, then they think what they did. The cop who killed that man, must go to jail for many years. Traser is not a gun and not a weapon."
1904,1906,I'm not shocked he was shot. Watch the security cam. Youd watch it coming
1905,1907,Police should not be allowed to carry weapons.
1906,1908,So why not show the part where he turned the the stun gun on the officer in chase.. Then fired  As usual you fail to report the full truth... Enemy of the People
1907,1909,I‚Äôm sorry for my language
1908,1910,More wood to the fire.
1909,1911,Did he turn to attack? Was he shot in the front or the back?
1910,1912,Here's a thought that most people won't think of. Drunk man now has a taser. Drunk man gets away from police because they let him. Drunk man steals a car. He's now driving a car running from the police. He crashes killing innocent people. FYI that scenario HAS happened. But you won't think about that one unless it's happened to a loved one.
1911,1913,I don't know what to think anymore really
1912,1914,Even if the man outran the police officers no reason to shoot him. They had his name his address his car. No reason to shoot. Put out a warrant pick him up at your convenience. There's no warrant for a dead man.
1913,1915,"Sad & pathetic , sorry for this man's friends & relitives. These cops need to be analyzed every 6 months for stress & mental fatigue."
1914,1916,No matter what you can't shoot or shoot to kill an unarmed man!!  I don't care if he resists arrest and runs...you can't kill him for that...it's murder!  Will you people never learn?!
1915,1917,He looked to me like he was passing the sobriety test.
1916,1918,The analyst was wrong. It's not just imminent death. It's also serious bodily injury i.e. losing an eye or permanent disfigurement.
1917,1919,"Always when I see this stuff... ""Where were you going to run to???"""
1918,1920,Why kill someone it's only a DUI
1919,1921,How did he get the policeman‚Äôs taser?  Seems like that is a mistake on the officer‚Äôs part.  This isn‚Äôt as clear cut as George Floyd but the police need to really be in fear of losing their lives before they shoot someone.  This officer‚Äôs mistake went from bad to worse.  At least aim for the legs.  They don‚Äôt have to shoot to kill.
1920,1922,"What‚Äòs the need for hand calf‚Äôs at all? If he was intoxicated, take his car keys, call him a taxi and ask him to pick up the keys the next day from the police station after paying the fine..... no need for shooting."
1921,1923,If you're unarmed and run from cops for a non violent crime like that you get a warrant for your arrest and they eventually track you down and you get way more charges and your life sucks and you might go to jail and pay lots of fines but you shouldn't be shot ffs. Like by that point they know who he is and had his ID and all that so why did they need to shoot him just chill got damn
1922,1924,"Question. If that would had been a white boy, do you think that the cop would had shot him in the back three times? Doubt it. Is it true that the shooter cop told the other cop, ""I got this."""
1923,1925,Holy Coppers  ? You're famous
1924,1926,He had a tazer not a gun
1925,1927,"#alllivesmatter
#eventheunborn
#bluelivesmattertoo"
1926,1928,Another one !
1927,1929,Police dogs are better law enforcement officers than human officers.
1928,1930,It's time to abolish the police force.
1929,1931,They have the green light. Simple as that. They have for a very long time. Just another example. Even if he did shoot a taser he deserved to die? üòìüòìüòìüòìüò•üò•üòíüòíüò†üò†ü§¨ü§¨üò°ü§ïü§ïüò°üò°ü§¨üò†üò†ü§¨üò°ü§ïüò†üòíüò†üò°ü§ïü§¨üòíüòíüò°üò°üò°üò†ü§ïüò°üòíüò°ü§¨üòíü§§üòìüòìü§§üòìüòìüòìüòìüò•üòìüòìüò•üòìüòìüòìüòì
1930,1932,"If you're desperate enough to tangle with armed cops, who knows what Brooks would have done? Obviously he didn't give a shite by driving while severely intoxicated."
1931,1933,So sad such a waste of life ..... why did he resist the police???
1932,1934,"When they went to handcuff him for having a .108 blood alcohol level. He resisted, and stole a taser from one of the officers. While running away. The guy  turns around and aims the taser at the officer. When he aims the taser. The officer shot him. 
This is a good shoot. "
1933,1935,"Law enforcement doesn‚Äôt even rank within the top ten most dangerous jobs in the US. The Wild West mentality and  unnecessary escalation needs to stop. Instead of being cowardly bullies with guns, do your job properly."
1934,1936,Its easy to say what should of happened until you are in the police officers shoes Mr im black the victim is black there for im on his side
1935,1937,He was running away and used an officers taser which is a less lethal defense doesn‚Äôt call for him to be shot in the back
1936,1938,So cops are able to put their body cam down now!? Why!? In what reason would u need to take off the body cam while on duty? I find it ridiculous that the body just happened to fall off right before the shooting.
1937,1939,You will never convince me that it is justified to shoot to kill someone without a firearm who has no access to your gun.
1938,1940,why struggle? just go with it.
1939,1941,"Why did he resist? Sure he was drunk. But it wasnt like he was Driving, he was parked. So the police cant arrest him for drunk driving. If anything, police wouldve taken him in to sober up and leave the car parked near by or at the most, a wet wreckless ticket."
1940,1942,"Really? Omg, no reason to kill a guy who fall asleep in his own car &  have no weapons! Oh dear, lucky I don't live in America..... Sad"
1941,1943,What now more protesting.  Smh.
1942,1944,Why he fights the cops? Didn't deserve to die.
1943,1945,stop resisting arrest maybe you won't get shot
1944,1946,Is it possible that taser went off because he was running. And he wasn't trying too shoot anyone just the motion of running and gravity and how he was holding it had anything too with it if it was a real gun it would be different.
1945,1947,"Oh my gosh, literally stole the cops taser and attempted to use it on the officer, what was he supposed to do let himself get tased and then get his gun stolen!?!?!"
1946,1948,"Unarmed citizens should not be confronted with three shots in the back, ever."
1947,1949,It's not about color of skin... it's about money and no money.
1948,1950,All that protesting and these Roman soldiers still killing.
1949,1951,I'm guessing all we will hear from Trump is how he plans to send in military to address this new wave of civil unrest.
1950,1952,"If you love your children teach them not to fight with police.  Black or white, right or wrong, when it gets physical it becomes dangerous for police and the person being arrested"
1951,1953,Police officers are not getting the training they need. That‚Äôs all to it. They need to retrain their officers once a month.
1952,1954,Why cnn ended the video early??? üëé
1953,1955,"I mean, they deceived us in the movies. There is no chase with black feet. He is killed instantly"
1954,1956,"Remember kids, don't drink, drive, resist arrest, attack a police officer, steal his taser, shoot it at him, miss, run and then get shot."
1955,1957,So we saying a non lethal already discharged taser gun even if shot...would be from a drunk man running 50ft away...is MORE accurate or dangerous as 2 cops with guns chasing...that it deserves death..  really...is life that cheap?
1956,1958,Another one huh?.....
1957,1959,What did Wendy‚Äôs do ?
1958,1960,So why do they shoot him? It‚Äôs just instant not giving a shit about life.
1959,1961,This is America
1960,1962,End of the day Im going home.
1961,1963,"I guess next time don't fight with the cops and steal their weapon, turn around and fire it at them."
1962,1964,"Nobody can bring back someone's life. We must do better as a society, as a free nation, and as Americans. Yes, Rayshard Brooks resisted arrest, although he wasn't dangerous, just scared -- that is NOT a valid reason for Police who Protest & Serve to murder Brooks. MANY people cooperate to the fullest extent, we all have seen the videos over the years and recently George Floyd. Being black shouldn't be treated as a crime, it's not a choice nor changeable. It's darker pigmentation of the skin. Racist opinions and bigotry CAN change."
1963,1965,I don't think cops should be using the gun unless the cop is needing to save his own life. I think they should only use there tazer guns as needed.
1964,1966,We won't stop till we get justice for ALL....
1965,1967,but he tried to reach to the taser stupid.
1966,1968,"Rayshard was  simply breathing just like any other one ,but he was black , he was sleeping in his car,is so hard to believe that he had to  die because of two dumbs  officers ,defunfing  police is a must"
1967,1969,"After a quick pat down you don't know anything. You assume you're safe enough to continue, but you don't know until they're in cuffs and you frisk them. They only know he doesn't have a shotgun."
1968,1970,"Ok, Well, there you go!. ""Don't be drinking and driving"". And don't be resisting from law enforcement. Simple. Sometime you have to think where you are at all time."
1969,1971,"Surprise surprise, another black man turns on the cops and gets shot. It's terrible, but what did he expect would happen? If you know you've committed a crime, just own up to it. If I were the cop, I would have let him run home and arrest him the next day."
1970,1972,Why do American police handcuff everyone ... the guy didn‚Äôt seem to be resisting prior.  To me it‚Äôs a ridiculous to handcuff everyone on arrest whatever their alleged clime.
1971,1973,So they basically shot an unarmed man in the back for being under the influence. That's murder with intent to kill or mame.
1972,1974,He literally shot the taser on the cop. Are you all blind?
1973,1975,Autonomous zones is the new America. We want the everywhere
1974,1976,"The guy could have tried to steal the cop's gun and CNN would report "" The man had his hands up while saying 'don't shoot'."
1975,1977,the USA is lost...and nobody gonna fix that...biden and trump they both have no idea...it will be an interesting november i guess
1976,1978,This doesn't justify the killing.
1977,1979,The officers were wrong. Your first instinct should not be to kill. Plus if he got away whats the big deal. It was only for drunk driving. You already had his vehicle and he could of easily be found later. They basically killed him so he wouldn‚Äôt get away. Being a Police office is a thinking job. You have to make right quick split second decision and the first decision should not always be to murder someone. In this situation it was not warranted. This is due to poor police training or officer who have the wrong perceptions as what it‚Äôs means to be an officer.
1978,1980,"Horrible, Black Must Fight Back"
1979,1981,This is BS..  you did not show perp point taser officer.   Fake news again
